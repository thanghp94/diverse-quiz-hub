a6f66c20;1c5484ee;;acc3baf3;e148d6e6;Science and Technology;;4143;"ntil last Monday, when engineers began hoisting its two-thousand-ton cutterhead to the surface, Bertha, the world’s largest tunnel-boring machine, was stuck a hundred and twenty feet below the streets of Seattle, too damaged to move far forward and incapable of going in reverse. The machine, which weighs some seven thousand tons and is about as long as a football field, is the centerpiece of a two-billion-dollar project to build a stretch of underground highway two miles long, two lanes wide, and two levels high. But, in December of 2013, after only four months and a thousand feet of digging, Bertha overheated and was shut down. Attempts to fix it set off a cascade of other construction problems, helping to secure the tunnel’s reputation as one of the biggest megaproject fiascoes in history.

The extravagant scale of the disarray in Seattle may seem exceptional, but among megaprojects—commonly understood to be projects that cost at least a billion dollars—the size of the undertaking is nothing special. According to Bent Flyvbjerg, a management professor at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School, megaprojects have come to constitute eight per cent of global gross domestic product. China is most responsible for this explosion—according to the scientist Vaclav Smil, the country used more cement between 2011 and 2013 than the United States did during the entire twentieth century—but many nations have contributed. The projects include not only tunnels, bridges, dams, and highways but also airports, hospitals, skyscrapers, cruise ships, wind farms, offshore oil and gas rigs, aluminum smelters, communications systems, Olympic Games, aerospace missions, particle accelerators, the Affordable Care Act Web site, entire cities—the list goes on and on.

Some of these projects are properly conceived and implemented—the nearly completed London Crossrail, which includes twenty-six miles of tunnels beneath London, will probably qualify—but they are the exception, according to Flyvbjerg. More common are worthy but poorly executed megaprojects, or megaprojects that never should have been attempted in the first place. The “iron law of megaprojects,” he wrote in a 2014 paper in Project Management Journal, is that they are “over budget, over time, over and over again.” Nine out of ten megaprojects experience cost overruns, and most take much longer to build than expected. What results, Flyvbjerg says, is the “survival of the un-fittest”: the least deserving projects get built precisely because their cost-benefit estimates are so misleadingly optimistic.

Superlatives are at the heart of our infatuation with megaprojects—the irresistible attraction of building the world’s tallest building or biggest cruise ship. And, as Flyvbjerg noted in his 2014 paper, megaprojects have broad appeal: engineers are delighted to develop new technology, politicians revel in the visibility they reap from building monuments to themselves, and everyone else—developers, bankers, lawyers, consultants, landowners, contractors, and construction workers—is happy to claim a share. If a project is an aesthetic success—like, say, the Sydney Opera House is (despite its fourteen-hundred-per-cent cost overrun, which derailed the career of its architect, Jørn Utzon)—the public may embrace it as an icon.

But the scale of megaprojects often leads to their undoing. Atif Ansar, a colleague of Flyvbjerg’s at Oxford, says that because such projects take so long to build—more than eight and a half years for the average large dam—they are vulnerable to a kind of entropy, in which even unrelated events can produce huge setbacks. The planners of Pakistan’s Tarbela Dam, for example, projected seven-and-a-half-per-cent inflation during construction, but the project took eight years longer to complete than expected, by which time inflation had jumped three hundred and eighty per cent and the total cost of the dam had quadrupled. The U.S. Defense Department is poised to spend eleven billion dollars modernizing its health-care-management system, but its acquisition standards virtually insure that the information technology it selects will be antiquated long before the system becomes operational. “Time is like a window through which black swans can fly,” Ansar told me, alluding to the so-called black-swan theory, which explains how unexpected events shape history. “The bigger the window, the more likely the birds fly in.”

Yet megaprojects seem to be practically recession-proof. In fact, the 2008 global economic slowdown likely spurred megaproject construction, since the governments of some countries—among them China, India, and the United States—saw investment in infrastructure as a way to stimulate growth. Moreover, many large corporations are virtually locked into megaprojects, because only mammoth undertakings seem capable of nudging their bottom lines. “It’s very simple logic, but it’s not necessarily smart,” Flyvbjerg told me. Megaprojects, he wrote in his 2014 paper, citing a Times Op-Ed, are “the ‘Vietnams’ of policy and management: ‘easy to begin and difficult and expensive to stop.’ ”

The Seattle project neatly corroborates Flyvbjerg’s findings. It is now due to be completed at the end of 2017, two years behind schedule, and Bertha’s delays have only added to the steadily mounting and still uncalculated costs. When the machine’s foundering led to calls for construction to be abandoned, officials summarily dismissed them. “There’s no turning back,” Tim Burgess, the president of the Seattle City Council, said in December, 2014. Instead, workers spent more than a year digging an eighty-three-foot-wide shaft down to it. Because Seattle’s water table is high, millions of gallons of water had to be pumped out from the site as the shaft was formed. The pumping, in turn, may have caused the surrounding land, in one of the city’s prime tourist areas, to settle by an inch or more; occupants of nearby buildings complain that cracks have begun appearing in their walls.

Last week, a massive crane, built specifically for the job, completed the two-week-long task of lifting to the surface key parts of the boring machine. When repairs are complete—not before the end of August “in the best of circumstances,” according to the project’s contractor, Seattle Tunnel Partners—the parts will be lowered back into the tunnel and reassembled. In the meantime, water will continue to be pumped around the shaft, possibly causing more subsidence. Buildings sit above most of the remaining tunnel route, so if Bertha fails again workers won’t be able to dig a new shaft to reach it. The only alternative—performing repairs from within the tunnel and through the machine’s long tail—would require even longer delays.

Bertha’s problems are not a complete surprise. In 2010, The Stranger, a Seattle alternative weekly, published an article called “What Could Possibly Go Wrong,” answering the question this way: “The tunnel-boring machine gets stuck.” The machine works best when it digs into a uniform substance, but the earth around the tunnel, known as fill, is highly variable, with complex combinations of soil types, pieces of metal and concrete, and possibly even boulders and car bodies. An engineering consultant hired by Mike McGinn, Seattle’s mayor at the time and an opponent of the tunnel, warned that the site’s poor soil conditions and high water table posed unprecedented risks. But a consultant hired by the city council, which favored the tunnel, concluded that the risks were manageable.

Flyvbjerg finds much of this familiar. He writes that megaproject planners are often outright dishonest, systematically overestimating​ benefits and underestimating costs. He cites an unusually candid comment that Willie Brown, a former speaker of the California State Assembly and mayor of San Francisco, made in a 2013 newspaper column. Referring to huge cost overruns during the construction of San Francisco’s four-and-a-half-billion-dollar Transbay Transit Center, Brown wrote, “We always knew the initial estimate was way under the real cost…. If people knew the real cost from the start, nothing would ever be approved. The idea is to get going. Start digging a hole and make it so big, there’s no alternative to coming up with the money to fill it in.”

Unfortunately, false cost-benefit estimates have a way of elevating big projects over more cost-efficient, less environmentally disruptive ones. At Oxford, Flyvbjerg directs a program that teaches megaproject managers how to make cost-benefit forecasts more accurate, but accurate budgets alone won’t clarify which projects merit approval. The decision is often as much about social, aesthetic, and even patriotic concerns as about economic ones; the last three skyscrapers to have claimed the title of “world’s tallest,” in Dubai, Taipei, and Kuala Lumpur, were intended, at least in part, to draw attention to their countries’ modernity. The projects suggest the allure of the grand and grandiose, as if their true function were to deliver reassurance that the human arc is upward.

The trouble with megaprojects is that their glitter can conceal the benefits of less imposing alternatives, for big isn’t necessarily best. In 2009, McGinn, a Sierra Club activist with little political experience and modest financial backing, was elected mayor of Seattle. He had campaigned against the tunnel, arguing for a cheaper​ option: a plan, already found feasible by an advisory council of city and state stakeholders, to develop the city’s light rail, expand bus service, and repair and reorganize streets. Pro-tunnel forces—including Washington State’s Democratic Governor, Christine Gregoire; Greg Nickels, McGinn’s predecessor as mayor; construction unions; and the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce—painted McGinn as an obstructionist, eventually winning unanimous approval from the City Council for the tunnel. In 2013, McGinn lost his bid for reëlection, but his opposition looks more prescient with each new crack that appears in the buildings above Bertha.";Bertha digging machine;"-**Bertha:**  The world’s **largest tunnel-boring machine** was stuck **120 feet** underground in Seattle.

a6f66c20;dcf350f4;;;;Social Studies;"Sejong city is a city not many people have heard of. To understand its existence, we must first understand the different kinds of “capitals” a country can have. While the much more famous Seoul is the effective capital city of South Korea, Sejong is the administrative capital. The city is relatively new, only having begun in 2007 as a “new planned capital meant to decongest Seoul”. (In essence, it was planned in a political campaign to distribute South Korea’s economic activity elsewhere.) Being a self-governing city, it follows a special set of laws different from the rest of South Korea (marginally similar to Hong Kong and China). 

To clarify Sejong’s “Capital status”, most of South Korea’s government affairs are handled in Sejong. As a compromise to an anti-Sejong lawsuit by the opposing government party, the definition had to be shifted slightly.

Sejong was designed to be a “smart city” (cities with common IoT integrations, akin to what you’d imagine a future city would look like) and is sort of a gold standard for other cities developing smart city infrastructure. The success of Sejong is debatable, as while the city markets itself as a Seoul alternative with lower living costs and similar features, its low population (of about 400,000) suggests the operation wasn’t popular. It has been criticized for being inaccessible, poorly designed, and inconvenient at times.

a6f66c20;14559d9e;;bed16a9b;;Science and Technology;"NEOM is by far the largest project on this list, quite literally a “mega-megaproject”. If ever completed, it would comprise of all of Saudi Arabia’s individual megaprojects, including the much more infamous “Oxagon” and “The Line” projects alongside their other propositions. The project, projected to cost over 8.8 TRILLION in total, would be larger than all of the other projects combined– in fact, it wouldn’t even be close. This giant project, as an autonomous city region, is the core of Saudi Arabia’s goal of distancing its economy from oil moving into the future.

NEOM’s project proposals first launched in 2017, hoping to complete large parts of an initially smaller scale operation by 2025 and expand it by 2025; the project ended up largely falling behind schedule, however. Much of the city is now hoped to be done by 2039, though the planned area of 26,500km^2 does make this hope quite ambitious. NEOM is certainly in progress, though; its first section, Sindalah (a luxury island destination), was opened to the public in October 2024!

This megaproject is notoriously flooded with controversies and problems largely derivative of its ambitious nature. The most famous example is the forced relocation of the local Howeitat tribe, who were initially not opposed to NEOM but inevitably turned on it after relocation attempts. In the scuffle, a few people were executed for anti-compliance. Other criticisms come with NEOM’s abusive work culture and its planned data collection.

Perhaps the most famous portion of NEOM is The Line, a conceptualized 170km long linear “smart city” designed without cars, streets, or carbon emissions.

Analysis From 113 Countries Shows The Harrowing Extent of Loneliness We Live With

Analysis from 113 countries shows the harrowing extent of loneliness we live with

More humans are alive today than ever before, and yet around the world, people are still feeling alone a lot of the time.

Even before the global pandemic hit, a sweeping meta analysis has found chronic or severe loneliness was a common and overlooked experience in numerous nations.


Past studies in the industrialized world have suggested loneliness is on the rise, but without historical data on the issue, it's hard to say how present-day numbers compare over time or across geographical regions.

""It's a commonly held belief that around 1 in 12 people experience loneliness at a level that can lead to serious health problems, however, the source of such data are unclear and researchers have never established how widespread loneliness is on a global scale,"" says epidemiologist Melody Ding from the University of Sydney.

""That is why we were interested in conducting the review.""

Ding and her colleagues have therefore pulled together 57 observational studies on loneliness from 113 countries or territories between 2000 and 2019.

The authors hope to use the findings as a pre-pandemic baseline to monitor feelings of lonesomeness going forward.

Because loneliness is associated with mental, emotional, and physical well-being, the findings could help reveal emerging issues in public health that must be better addressed.

Global loneliness estimates were mostly available for adolescents, and findings among 77 nations suggest the issue can range from 9.2 percent in South-East Asia to 14.4 percent in the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Unfortunately, for adults, there was only enough data for the meta analysis to hone in on the European region.


In this corner of the world, the authors once again found geographical differences. Northern European nations had the lowest rates of loneliness, with only 2.9 percent of young adults experiencing the negative emotion and 2.7 percent of middle-aged adults feeling the same. Older adults, over the age of 60, experienced lonesomeness at a higher rate of 5.3 percent.

Eastern European countries, on the other hand, showed more signs of loneliness than anywhere else in Europe. Young adults in Eastern Europe reported feelings of loneliness at a rate of 7.5 percent, while middle aged adults reported feelings of loneliness at a rate of 9.6 percent. Older adults in this part of Europe, meanwhile, were the loneliest of the lot, coming in at a worrisome 21.3 percent.

The data can't tell us why Eastern Europe appears to have a more lonely populace overall, but one study included in the review suggests the effect is due to worse health outcomes, healthcare services, and social support.

Welfare systems and social security schemes are commonly put forward as explanations for reduced loneliness, and northern European countries tend to excel in these areas. Further research will be needed to confirm the hypothesis.

""Understanding loneliness as a global health issue requires data from most countries – however, data are lacking for most regions outside of Europe,"" the authors write.


""Meanwhile, the lack of repeated measurements limited our conclusions about temporal trends.""

Meaning we have no idea how these numbers compare to decades gone by. If the problem of loneliness is worsening, it's important public health experts and policymakers know so they can take appropriate action.

Never has that been more important than now. The World Health Organization has warned that the social isolation measures keeping the dangerous SARS-CoV-2 virus at bay will also probably lead to increased levels of loneliness, depression, harmful alcohol and drug use, and self-harm or suicidal behavior.

The current review could find no low-income countries with nationally representative data on loneliness in adults, due to limited resources and competing priorities.

These major data gaps are leaving us blind to a common and global issue, which can have impacts on mental health and physical health at all ages. Social isolation and loneliness have actually been associated with a rise in the risk of early death, on a scale equivalent to smoking cigarettes. Yet it's unclear what mechanism is driving that fatal relationship.

Census data in the United States has found more young and middle-aged people today are living alone than in previous years. But in the European review it seems older adults, over the age of 60, are those most likely to suffer feelings of severe loneliness.


The differing results among nations suggest the age pattern of loneliness might be context specific, but we need more data to say for certain.

When our lives literally depend on connecting with others, it's shocking that more research on loneliness and isolation hasn't been done.

Now, the global pandemic has made us aware of the issue like never before, and researchers like Ding are scrambling to make sense of the little information we have so we can make informed decisions about the future.

""A public health approach to loneliness means confronting the social and structural factors that influence risk of loneliness across the life course, including poverty, education, transport, inequalities, and housing, and implementing policies to address them,"" a team of Irish and UK public health experts writes in an editorial linked to the new research.

""It is important to facilitate healthy social choices, making it easier to connect with others in the community, change work environments, and increase opportunities for building trust and social capital.""

In simple, it has the most amount of water, the ability to hold the most energy, and it makes the most energy.

The idea of the dam was first posed in 1919, though the construction didn’t begin 1994. The dam, largely supported by the Chinese Communist Party, picked up pace in the “Four Modernizations/Reform and Opening Up” period of the country (around 1970s). Eventually, with projects added along the way delaying the opening, the dam began full operation in 2012. While initially it was expected to supply 10% of China’s power, exponentially increasing energy demands led it to only provide for 1.7% of the demand at best.

The construction faced large controversies, considering its construction would displace over 1 million people, alongside culturally significant sites and biodiverse habitats. (The dam is considered at fault for the extinction of the Chinese river dolphin). The dam’s construction caused erosion in nearby areas, sitting on a faultline and causing sediment to deposit in the river.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared loneliness to be a pressing global health threat, with the US surgeon general saying that its mortality effects are equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

WHO has launched an international commission on the problem – led by the US surgeon general, Dr Vivek Murthy, and the African Union youth envoy, Chido Mpemba – of 11 advocates and government ministers, including Ralph Regenvanu, the minister of climate change adaptation in Vanuatu, and Ayuko Kato, the minister in charge of measures for loneliness and isolation in Japan.

It comes after the Covid-19 pandemic halted economic and social activity, increasing levels of loneliness, but also amid a new awareness of the importance of the issue. The WHO commission on social connection will run for three years.


“[Loneliness] transcends borders and is becoming a global public health concern affecting every facet of health, wellbeing and development,” said Mpemba. “Social isolation knows no age or boundaries.”

The health risks are as bad as smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day, and even greater than those associated with obesity and physical inactivity, according to Murthy.

While loneliness is often seen as a problem for developed countries, Murthy said the rates of one in four older people experiencing social isolation are similar in all regions of the world.

In older adults, loneliness is associated with a 50% increased risk of developing dementia and a 30% increased risk of incident coronary artery disease or stroke.

But it also blights the lives of young people. Between 5% and 15% of adolescents are lonely, according to figures that are likely to be underestimates. In Africa, 12.7% adolescents experience loneliness compared to 5.3% in Europe.

Young people experiencing loneliness at school are more likely to drop out of university. It can also lead to poorer economic outcomes; feeling disconnected and unsupported in a job can lead to poorer job satisfaction and performance.

Mpemba said that across Africa, where most of the population is made up of young people, challenges around peace, security and the climate crisis, as well as high levels of unemployment, are contributing to social isolation. “We believe it’s important to redefine the narrative surrounding loneliness particularly for vulnerable populations excluded by the digital divide,” she said.

Murthy added: “These issues don’t affect one country … [Loneliness] is an underappreciated public health threat.”";Loneliness spreading fast;"- **Definition of Loneliness:**  Loneliness is the feeling of being alone or isolated, even when surrounded by others.

Hiyasu Uraki points to the white, fluffy seal on the table in front of us. “You should also sing to it,” she instructs me. As I start singing, the seal looks up, blinks at me and gently coos. A smile spreads across Uraki’s face.

This is Paro, a robotic seal at Tokyo’s Silver Wing care facility aimed at providing residents like Uraki with therapy and social interactions. Uraki won’t give her precise age; she’ll only say 80-something. “She often says that, but actually she’s 99 years old,” the care facility manager, Yukari Sekigichi, interjects, and we all share a laugh.

Residents often talk to the seals ― there were four on the table in front of us ― about everyday events such as the weather. “They also serve as a starting point for conversations between residents,” Sekigichi explains.

Robots like Paro, designed to provide companionship, are part of a range of technologies that have emerged in Japan to combat rising loneliness.

Loneliness is a big issue in the country of 127 million, which has the oldest population in the world. Statistics focusing on loneliness in Japan are scarce, but an estimated 6.24 million Japanese people over 65, and a total of 18.4 million adults ― twice as many as 30 years ago ― live alone. By 2040, 40 percent of the country’s inhabitants will be solo dwellers.

The consequence of this has been a rise in kodokushi ― people dying alone and remaining undiscovered for long periods of time ― especially among younger generations. One estimate is that there are 30,000 of these lonely deaths a year, but companies that clean apartments when kodokushi are discovered say the number could be two or three times higher.

Amid this rising social phenomenon ― a public health concern linked to depression, dementia and heart disease ― businesses see an opportunity through technology. Robots like Paro can be programmed to fill social gaps that can lead to loneliness.

The Scourge Of Loneliness
In her book, Sekai Ichi Kodoku na Nihon no Ojisan (Japan’s Old Men are the World’s Loneliest), psychologist Junko Okamoto dubs Japan the “loneliness superpower.” She told the Financial Times: “Society is not doing enough to address loneliness and people don’t want to admit how unhappy they are.”

Modern life in Japan, which has had its foot to the economic pedal for decades, may have come at a cost: the unpicking of traditional social structures. “The increase in loneliness, and lonely deaths, is partly tied to traditional family structures falling apart,” says Masaki Ichinose, a professor at the Center for Life and Death Studies at the University of Tokyo.

Western-style nuclear families have taken the place of traditional, multi-generational households, which used to serve as a social safety net for especially the elderly, says Ichinose.

Many workers face punishing hours, fueling the phenomenon of karōshi, or death by overwork. At the less extreme end of the spectrum, grueling work schedules leave people with little time to find partners and have children.

Life can be equally challenging, if not more so, for the growing slice of the population unable to find permanent jobs. A prolonged economic slump means that while unemployment is low, steady good-paying jobs remain hard to come by. Many people end up working several jobs to make ends meet, allowing little time to socialize.

For some people in Japan, the pressures have led them to withdraw from society altogether. Professor Takahiro Kato at Kyushu University’s Department of Neuropsychiatry studies loneliness and hikikomori (or shut-ins), the trend for people to live in isolation for a year or more. Kato points out that data is sparse, but a study by the Japanese government showed there to be 500,000 hikikomori aged 16 to 39. “The initial findings before 2000 were that it was mostly young people. However, we have seen a marked increase in hikikomori amongst middle-aged and old people,” he says.

The Technological Solution
For Japan, part of the answer to the growing loneliness is technology ― and that technology is becoming increasingly life-like.

Sony’s Aibo robot dogs, for example, re-launched by maker Sony after being retired in 2006, inspire such an emotional bond with their owners that some hold funerals when the robotic pets stop working.

Tech giant Softbank Robotics produces the Pepper robot, a humanoid designed to provide companionship, which some have taken to integrating into their family as substitute children or grandchildren. At Silver Wing care facility, Pepper is in charge of the midday exercise session.

Perhaps one of the best examples of how the robots offer companionship is the Telenoid R1. Like others, its minimalistic design is meant to make it easier for users to project faces of, for example, family members when they speak with it.

A whole industry also has sprung up to provide company to younger customers, primarily men, who aren’t having human relationships. (A 2013 study found that 30 percent of Japanese men in their 20s and 30s had never dated.) Gatebox has developed the anime-inspired VR-companion, tailored toward younger men who, due to long work hours or other reasons, prefer the company of a virtual partner.

Japanese startup Couger is developing an AI-powered virtual assistant that can follow a user around, and move seamlessly from device to device. Company founder Atsushi Ishii says part of the goal is creating a system that people can relate to on a personal level, perhaps making them feel less lonely.

“Humans and AI-powered technology, like robots and virtual assistants, should have a relationship like friends. One that is built on trust and one where people can perhaps open up to ― and build a social relation to ― the technological solution easier than they can to a person,” Ishii says.

Outsourcing Empathy
This technology does seem to work, says Takanori Shibata, a professor at Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. “Studies showed that interaction with Paro improved loneliness significantly,” says Shibata.

Clinical psychologist Puihan Joyce Chao, who treats many people suffering from extreme loneliness, agrees technology can provide part of the answer, but stresses the need to include a human element. Combating loneliness, she says, “starts on the individual level, and perhaps with a focus more on quality than quantity of connections and interactions. … Perhaps this is something that needs to be a focal point ― that we teach children and younger generations how to experience and be in the moment with the people around you.”

The idea of outsourcing the human need for care, contact and empathy to machines worries some. “Humans need human interaction; that is how we are evolved. We would want any technological solution like a friendship app to be used alongside offline connection,” says Laura Alcock-Ferguson, executive director of the Campaign to End Loneliness, a U.K.-based network.

Rising loneliness is not just a Japanese phenomenon. In the U.K., 500,000 elderly people say they go at least five days a week without seeing or speaking to anyone. The country is the world’s first to have a minister for loneliness. And in the U.S., a study in May 2018 showed that nearly half of Americans sometimes or always feel alone, and that loneliness was especially pronounced for young people.

Back at the Silver Wing care facility, manager Sekigichi, says at-home care would be preferable for the residents, but “the reality is that many elderly live alone and struggle to manage life on their own.” The robots help, she says. Relatives of some of the day care patients were amazed to see how much they interacted with the robots when they are at the center, compared with how little they are able to do in their homes. But Sekigichi, too, emphasizes the need for human contact: “Robots and technology can be used for some aspects, but we need humans to give full care to others.”";Japan Technology solution to Loneliness;"- **Loneliness Epidemic:**  Japan has a growing issue with loneliness, especially among the elderly.

The country wanted robots to help care for the elderly. What happened?

It’s a picture you may have seen before: a large white robot with a cute teddy bear face cradling a smiling woman in its arms. Images of Robear, a prototype lifting robot, have been reproduced endlessly. They still hold a prominent position in Google Image search results for “care robot.” The photos seem designed to evoke a sense of how far robots have come—and how we might be able to rely on them in the near future to help care for others. But devices such as Robear, which was developed in Japan in 2015, have yet to be normalized in care facilities or private homes. 

Why haven’t they taken off? The answer tells us something about the limitations of techno-solutionism and the urgent need to rethink our approach to care. 

Japan has been developing robots to care for older people for over two decades, with public and private investment accelerating markedly in the 2010s. By 2018, the national government alone had spent well in excess of $300 million funding research and development for such devices. At first glance, the reason for racing to roboticize care may seem obvious. Almost any news article, presentation, or academic paper on the subject is prefaced by an array of anxiety-­inducing facts and figures about Japan’s aging population: birth rates are below replacement levels, the population has started to shrink, and though in 2000 there were about four working-age adults for every person over 65, by 2050 the two groups will be near parity. The number of older people requiring care is increasing rapidly, as is the cost of caring for them. At the same time, the already large shortage of care workers is expected to get much worse over the next decade. There’s little doubt that many people in Japan see robots as a way to fill in for these missing workers without paying higher wages or confronting difficult questions about importing cheap immigrant labor, which successive conservative Japanese governments have tried to curtail.

Care robots come in various shapes and sizes. Some are meant for physical care, including machines that can help lift older people if they’re unable to get up by themselves; assist with mobility and exercise; monitor their physical activity and detect falls; feed them; and help them take a bath or use the toilet. Others are aimed at engaging older people socially and emotionally in order to manage, reduce, and even prevent cognitive decline; they might also provide companionship and therapy for lonely older people, make those with dementia-related conditions easier for care staff to manage, and reduce the number of caregivers required for day-to-day care. These robots tend to be expensive to buy or lease, and so far most have been marketed toward residential care facilities. 


A growing body of evidence is finding that robots tend to end up creating more work for caregivers.

In Japan, robots are often assumed to be a natural solution to the “problem” of elder care. The country has extensive expertise in industrial robotics and led the world for decades in humanoid-robot research. At the same time, many Japanese people seem—on the surface, at least—to welcome the idea of interacting with robots in everyday life. Commentators often point to supposed religious and cultural explanations for this apparent affinity—specifically, an animist worldview that encourages people to view robots as having some kind of spirit of their own, and the huge popularity of robot characters in manga and animation. Robotics companies and supportive policy makers have promoted the idea that care robots will relieve the burden on human care workers and become a major new export industry for Japanese manufacturers. The title of not one but two books (published in 2006 and 2011 and written by Nakayama Shin and Kishi Nobuhito, respectively) sums up this belief: Robots Will Save Japan.

Japan is a pioneer in care automation. Well-known devices include this prototype lifting robot, Robear.
The reality, of course, is more complex, and the popularity of robots among Japanese people relies in large part on decades of relentless promotion by state, media, and industry. Accepting the idea of robots is one thing; being willing to interact with them in real life is quite another. What’s more, their real-life abilities trail far behind the expectations shaped by their hyped-up image. It’s something of an inconvenient truth for the robot enthusiasts that despite the publicity, government support, and subsidies—and the real technological achievements of engineers and programmers—robots don’t really feature in any major aspect of most people’s daily lives in Japan, including elder care. 

A major national survey of over 9,000 elder-care institutions in Japan showed that in 2019, only about 10% reported having introduced any care robot, while a 2021 study found that out of a sample of 444 people who provided home care, only 2% had experience with a care robot. There is some evidence to suggest that when robots are purchased, they often end up being used for only a short time before being locked away in a cupboard. 

My research has focused on this disconnect between the promise of care robots and their actual introduction and use. Since 2016, I have spent more than 18 months conducting ethnographic fieldwork in Japan, including spending time at a nursing care home that was trialing three of them: Hug, a lifting robot; Paro, a robotic seal; and Pepper, a humanoid robot. Hug was meant to prevent care workers from having to manually lift residents, Paro to offer a robotic form of animal therapy (while also acting as a distraction aid for some people with dementia who made repeated demands of staff throughout the day), and Pepper to run recreational exercise sessions so that staff would be freed for other duties.

But problems quickly became apparent. Staff stopped using Hug after only a few days, saying it was cumbersome and time consuming to wheel from room to room—cutting into the time they had to interact with the residents. And only a small number of them could be lifted comfortably using the machine. 

Paro was received more favorably by staff and residents alike. Shaped like a fluffy, soft toy seal, it can make noises, move its head, and wiggle its tail when users pet and talk to it. At first, care workers were quite happy with the robot. However, difficulties soon emerged. One resident kept trying to “skin” Paro by removing its outer layer of synthetic fur, while another developed a very close attachment, refusing to eat meals or go to bed without having it by her side. Staff ended up having to keep a close eye on Paro’s interactions with residents, and it didn’t seem to reduce the repetitive behavior patterns of those with severe dementia. 

Pepper was used to run recreation sessions that were held every afternoon. Instead of leading an activity like karaoke or having a conversation with residents, a care worker would spend some time booting up Pepper and wheeling it to the front of the room. It would then come to life, playing some upbeat music and a prerecorded presentation in its chirpy voice, and launch into a series of upper-body exercises so the residents could follow along. But care workers quickly realized that to get residents to participate in the exercise routine, they had to stand next to the robot, copying its movements and echoing its instructions. Since there was a relatively small set of songs and exercise routines, boredom also started to set in after a few weeks, and they ended up using Pepper less often. 

Care crises aren’t the natural or inevitable result of demographic aging. Instead, they are the result of specific political and economic choices.

In short, the machines failed to save labor. The care robots themselves required care: they had to be moved around, maintained, cleaned, booted up, operated, repeatedly explained to residents, constantly monitored during use, and stored away afterwards. Indeed, a growing body of evidence from other studies is finding that robots tend to end up creating more work for caregivers. 

But what was interesting was the type of work that they created. Whereas previously care workers came up with their own recreational activities, now they just had to copy Pepper. Instead of conversing and interacting with residents, now they could give them Paro to play with and monitor the interaction from a distance. And where workers who had to lift a resident had used the occasion to have a chat and build their relationship, those using the Hug machine had to shorten the interaction so they’d have time to wheel the robot back to where it was stored. In each case, existing social and communication-­oriented tasks tended to be displaced by new tasks that involved more interaction with the robots than with the residents. Instead of saving time for staff to do more of the human labor of social and emotional care, the robots actually reduced the scope for such work. 

What kind of future do such devices point to, and what would it take for them to become a “solution” to the care crisis?Bearing in mind the imperative to control costs, it seems that the most likely scenario for wide-scale use of such robots in residential care would involve—unfortunately—employing more people with fewer skills, who would be paid as little as possible. Care facilities would likely need to be much larger and highly standardized to enable economies of scale that could make the cost of robotic devices affordable, since they are generally expensive to buy or lease even with government subsidies. Because workers might not have to interact with residents as much and could theoretically get by with less care training, experience, and facility with the Japanese language, they could potentially be brought in more easily from abroad. In fact, such a vision might already be in the works: migration channels in Japan have been rapidly opened up over the past few years as concern has grown about the country’s labor shortages, and consolidation in the care industry has been accelerating.

Such a scenario may eventually make some kind of financial sense, but it seems far from many people’s understanding of what constitutes good care—or decent work. In the words of roboticist and professor of robot ethics Alan Winfield, talking about the wider application of AI and robots: “The reality is that AI is in fact generating a large number of jobs already. That is the good news. The bad news is that they are mostly crap jobs … It is now clear that working as human assistants to robots and AIs in the 21st century is dull, and both physically and/or psychologically dangerous … these humans are required to behave, in fact, as if they are robots.”

Interest in care robots continues. The European Union invested €85 million ($103 million) in a research and development program called “Robotics for Ageing Well” in 2015–2020, and in 2019, the UK government announced an investment of £34 million ($48 million) in robots for adult social care, stating that they could “revolutionize” the care system and highlighting Paro and Pepper as successful examples.

But care is not simply a logistical matter of maintaining bodies. It is a shared social, political, and economic endeavor that ultimately relies on human relationships. Likewise, care crises aren’t the natural or inevitable result of demographic aging, as is often suggested by crisis narratives used to explain and promote care robots. Instead, they are the result of specific political and economic choices. 

While care robots are technologically sophisticated and those promoting them are (usually) well intentioned, they may act as a shiny, expensive distraction from tough choices about how we value people and allocate resources in our societies, encouraging policy makers to defer difficult decisions in the hope that future technologies will “save” society from the problems of an aging population. And this is not even to mention the potentially toxic and exploitative processes of resource extraction, dumping of e-waste in the Global South, and other negative environmental impacts that massively scaling up robotic care would entail.

Alternative approaches are possible and, indeed, readily available. Most obviously, paying care workers more, improving working conditions, better supporting informal caregivers, providing more effective social support for older people, and educating people across society about the needs of this population could all help build more caring and equitable societies without resorting to techno-fixes.Technology clearly has a role to play, but a growing body of evidence points to the need for far more collaboration across disciplines and the importance of care-led approaches to developing and deploying technology, with the active involvement of the people being cared for as well as the people caring for them.

Like many depictions of robots, the images of Robear conceal as much as they reveal. Robear was an experimental research project never actually used in a care home setting, being too impractical and expensive for real-life deployment. The project has long since been retired, and its inventor has claimed that it was not a solution to the problems facing the care industry in Japan; he said migrant labor was a better answer. Since my fieldwork ended, Pepper too has been discontinued. But such robots continue to have a long afterlife, particularly in online media—projecting and maintaining a techno-­orientalist image of a futuristic Japan.

Parenting teenagers in 2022 generally entails worrying about their use of platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok; multiple studies point to links between social-media use and anxiety and depression among children and adolescents. Yet a new study reveals similar associations between depression and social-media use for their parents and grandparents too.

The findings come out of the COVID States Project, a series of surveys of adults in all 50 states, which began in spring 2020, soon after the pandemic began. It’s led by a multidisciplinary team of researchers from four universities, including Roy Perlis, the Dozoretz Professor of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics. For this study, they identified more than 5,000 people, with an average age of 56, who showed no signs of depression as measured by a standard screening. Participants initially were asked if they use social media. When surveyed again later, those who used Snapchat, Facebook, and TikTok were more likely to report symptoms of depression.

“Most of the prior literature focused on kids or young adults,” Perlis explains. “But in 2022 older adults also use social media, and we know almost nothing about the relationship between social media and anxiety and depression in older adults.” Such questions feel particularly pressing given the mental-health impact of the pandemic. “Rates of depression and anxiety were very high early in the pandemic,” he says, “and they’ve remained about three times greater than they would be normally.”

Findings about mental health and social-media use can be tricky to interpret. Most studies can’t prove that using Facebook or Instagram causes depression, Perlis cautions. These studies often capture a single moment in time and show that people who use social media report more symptoms of anxiety and depression. This may mean that being anxious or depressed makes a person more likely to engage with social media. Or, “maybe people who use social media are more prone to depression because the same sort of traits or personality, characteristics or feelings, the same things that make them more apt to use social media also make them more apt to become depressed,” he suggests. Perhaps social-media users get their news in a format that offers less balanced coverage or promotes “doomscrolling,” dampening mood in the process. Maybe “they are using social media instead of seeing other people,” Perlis offers, “or they’re using social media because they don’t have social supports in the real world.”

This latest study still can’t explain what triggers depression among social-media users, he acknowledges, but it “lets us start to cross off alternative explanations for the relationship that we’ve seen.” The researchers knew the study participants were not depressed when the study began, and since it was conducted over time, it enabled them to see the depression symptoms appear. Their analysis also showed that the participants’ news sources, number of social supports, and face-to-face time with others did not meaningfully affect their levels of depression.

In an intriguing set of findings, the researchers identified links between particular social-media platforms and depression in certain age groups. For example, Facebook use was associated with depression among people younger than 35, but not for those over 35. In the over-35 group, TikTok and Snapchat were connected to depression symptoms. “I think we have more work to do to understand why the associations are so different across different age groups of adults,” Perlis says. “I would say that was the thing that made me the most eager to do follow-up studies and try to understand what’s going on.”

Although the study can’t confirm why social media might be linked to depression, Perlis speculates that “what seems to be the case in kids is probably true in adults: constantly looking at images of people who appear to be happier than you, and more successful than you, who generally seem to have a better life than you, certainly doesn’t make most people feel better.” A barrage of negative images isn’t likely to help either. Social media is like “drinking from a firehose,” he says, in contrast with older forms of media, which offer smaller doses of potentially harmful images.

 As a neurobiologist, Perlis says this work falls outside his typical research areas. “I spend a lot of my time in the wet lab making stem-cell models of brain diseases,” he explains. But when the Kennedy School’s Della Volpe asked him to join the COVID States project to consider issues such as mental health and social-media use, he felt compelled to say yes. “I come at this as a psychiatrist, an epidemiologist, and a parent,” he says. “I wonder every day when I see my kids on their phones: What’s this doing exactly? How much is okay? As with so many other things, there probably are levels of use that are perfectly okay, and a point where maybe it becomes less healthy.” Answering all the unknowns about social media and mental health, including the question of “how much,” Perlis adds, requires future research.

He’s hoping to motivate “others who have been working closer in this area” to dive into such questions. If social media are being used by people who are vulnerable to mental-health problems, perhaps these platforms can be used creatively to reach them and provide help when needed, Perlis suggests. “How do we use social media to encourage healthy behaviors, so it potentially contributes to public health? That’s the sort of work that I’d like to see done.”";Social media affect Adults and Seniors;"- **Social Media Impact:**  Studies show links between **social media use** and **depression** in both teens and older adults.

Living standards declining in 90% of countries — UN
09/08/2022September 8, 2022
The UN's Human Development Index has declined globally for two years in a row for the first time in 32 years amid the combined effects of climate change, the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

Living conditions in 90% of the world's countries deteriorated in 2021, according to the UN Development Programme (UNDP).

The UNDP's Human Development Index measures a country's health, education and standard of living.

'Uncertainty complex' from multiple crises
The index has declined globally for two years in a row since the first time it was calculated 32 years ago. The UNDP's report said that this erased ""the gains of the past five years.""

UNDP chief Achim Steiner said that even at the height of the last global recession which broke out in 2007, the index declined in only around one in ten countries.

The combined effects of climate change, the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic have created an ""uncertainty complex"" exerting downward pressure on global living standards, the report said.

""Navigating this new uncertainty complex is hampered by persistent deprivations and inequalities in human development,"" it added, referring to stark global disparities in living standards.

""We are living through very distressing times, whether it is a world underwater, a world with no water, a world on fire or a world in the midst of the pandemic,"" Steiner said.

What does the data show?
According to the index, Switzerland is the most highly developed country in the world. Norway and Iceland come at a close second and third place.

Germany came in at ninth place, behind Sweden, Denmark and Ireland, but ahead of the Netherlands and Finland.

The United States took first place in 1990 when the index was first calculated, but has since slipped to 21st place.

The least developed country listed in the ranking is South Sudan, followed by Chad and Niger.

North Korea, Somalia, Nauru and Monaco were not listed on the index.

The 2021 index data counts Hong Kong, which came in at fourth place as the most highly developed territory in Asia, separately from mainland China, but not Taiwan or Macao.

The report pointed out that ""not all indicators were available for all countries,"" and urged readers to use ""caution"" in drawing comparisons between countries.";Living conditions decline in 90% of countries;"- **Global Decline:**  The UN's Human Development Index has fallen for the **first time in 32 years**.

Adrian Drayton
Mon, 2nd September 2024
  

Politicians are regularly talking about the Cost-of-Living Crisis as if somehow we will all be led out of the wilderness like Moses and everything will go back to the way it was. New schools of thought say this isn’t so.

The NSW Council of Social Service released its annual Cost of Living in NSW research, investigating cost-of-living pressures for people living below the poverty line and low-income households in NSW.

Undertaken by the Institute of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Technology, Sydney in April of 2023, this research engaged 1,134 NSW residents through an online survey, 23 focus groups, and interview participants.

The report, titled Barely Hanging On: The Cost-of-Living Crisis in NSW explores the experiences across a range of issues such as housing, employment, income and financial hardship. As the report title suggests the findings were grim and it has now been a year since this research was commissioned and little has changed.

Once perceived as a temporary economic anomaly, The Cost-of-Living Crisis has evolved into a persistent, structural feature of contemporary society or the new normal. This shift from a crisis to the new normal is intricately linked with broader systemic challenges that are both local and global in nature.

More recently authors and scientists have been looking at the intersection between, finance, technology and climate change to talk about a new economic reality known simply as the “Meta Crisis”.

The term “Meta Crisis” refers to the interconnected, complex crises that overlap and amplify one another. This complex intersection of finance, technology (and the rise and rise of AI), and climate change presents a multifaceted challenge that will reshape the global economy and force politicians to consider the broader societal implications facing communities, locally and globally.

Author and speaker Daniel Schmachtenberger is the founder of Civilization Research Institute and founding member of The Consilience Project and has extensively explored the concept of the meta-crisis. His work focuses on the interconnected nature of global issues like climate change, economic instability, and technological disruptions, and the religious and even philosophical implications of the Meta Crisis and how these crises interact and amplify one another.

No Longer a Crisis – the New Normal
Traditionally, economic crises were characterised by sudden shocks: financial collapses, market crashes, or sudden inflation spikes. However, today’s cost-of-living crisis manifests as a steady, incremental strain on household finances.

This is due to numerous factors. Wage growth has not kept pace with inflation, particularly in housing, healthcare, and education. This disconnect means that even as nominal wages increase, real purchasing power often declines.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted vulnerabilities in global supply chains, leading to shortages and increased prices. While some disruptions have abated, underlying issues remain, exacerbating the cost of living.

Central banks’ responses to inflation have included raising interest rates. While this aims to control inflation, it also increases borrowing costs, impacting mortgages, loans, and consumer spending.

Real estate markets in many regions have experienced dramatic price increases, driven by both speculative investment and limited supply. This trend has made homeownership increasingly unattainable for many.

Understanding Intersectional Challenges
The term “Meta Crisis” refers to the interconnected, complex crises that overlap and amplify one another. The intersection of finance, technology, and climate presents a multifaceted challenge that reshapes the global economy in several ways:

Economic Disparities: The financialisation of economies has led to growing wealth inequality. Investment in high-yield assets often benefits those already wealthy, while low-income households face financial precarity.
Debt Levels: High levels of personal and national debt create vulnerabilities. Economic downturns or shifts in policy can exacerbate these vulnerabilities, leading to broader financial instability.
Automation and Job Displacement: Technologically disruptive advances in artificial intelligence and automation are transforming labour markets. While technology can increase productivity, it also risks displacing workers, particularly in low-skilled sectors.
Digital Divide: Access to technology varies widely, impacting economic opportunities. Those without adequate digital infrastructure or skills face exclusion from emerging economic benefits.
Environmental Costs: Climate change has very tangible economic impacts, from damage to infrastructure due to extreme weather events to increased insurance costs and resource scarcity.
Transition Costs: Shifting to sustainable practices and renewable energy requires significant investment. While necessary for long-term sustainability, these transitions can impose short-term economic burdens on businesses and consumers.
Global Impact of Temperature Rise
Climate scientists have increasingly warned that a global temperature rise of 2°C above pre-industrial levels could have severe economic consequences and exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis. This threshold, set under the Paris Agreement, is considered a critical tipping point with broad implications for global stability.

A 2°C increase could lead to economic crises and higher living costs in a number of ways including the increased frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, heatwaves, and floods.

Agricultural Disruptions include reduced crop yields with igher temperatures and altered precipitation patterns negatively impacting crop yields. This reduction can lead to higher food prices, contributing to the cost-of-living crisis. Regions that are already vulnerable, such as parts of Africa and South Asia, could face even more severe food shortages, leading to both humanitarian and economic crises.

Climate change also exacerbates water scarcity by altering precipitation patterns and increasing evaporation rates. Reduced water availability can impact agriculture, industry, and daily life, driving up costs for water and related products.

Coastal cities face increased flooding risks, leading to property damage, higher insurance costs, and potential displacement of communities.

Higher temperatures ultimately will drive up energy consumption as demand for cooling increases. This surge in energy demand can strain power grids, increase energy prices, and contribute to overall higher living costs.

Increased frequency of natural disasters can lead to higher insurance premiums and reduced availability of coverage. This shift can place a greater financial burden on individuals and businesses, further straining economic stability.

The economic effects of climate change are often felt most acutely by low-income and vulnerable populations. Rising costs for essentials like food, water, and housing can exacerbate existing inequalities, making it more difficult for these groups to cope with the cost-of-living crisis.

Climate-induced disruptions to global supply chains can lead to volatility in commodity prices and economic instability. For instance, disruptions in the supply of key resources can affect global markets, leading to increased costs and economic uncertainty.

Intersecting Impacts on the Global Economy
Countries and communities that adapt to these challenges with robust social safety nets, innovative policies, and investments in green technologies may fare better. Resilience strategies include investing in education, diversifying economies, and fostering inclusive growth.

Effective policy responses are crucial. Governments must balance short-term relief with long-term sustainability. This involves crafting regulations that address financial risks, promote technological equity, and mitigate climate impacts.

Addressing these challenges requires international cooperation. Global supply chains, climate change, and technological advancements transcend national borders, necessitating collaborative solutions and shared responsibilities.

The cost-of-living crisis, now entrenched as the new normal, reflects deeper, systemic shifts within the global economy. The meta crisis framework reveals how finance, technology, and climate intersect to create complex, interconnected challenges.

Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing effective strategies to navigate and mitigate the impacts of this new economic reality.

As societies adapt, the focus must remain on fostering resilience communities, promoting equitable growth, and ensuring that policy responses address both immediate needs and long-term sustainability.

John Ibbitson is writer at large at The Globe and Mail. Darrell Bricker is CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs. They are the authors of Empty Planet: The Shock of Global Population Decline.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida had a grim message. The country’s extremely low birth rate had placed the nation’s future in peril.

“Japan is standing on the verge of whether we can continue to function as a society,” he declared in a speech in January to the country’s national legislature, the Diet.

“Focusing attention on policies regarding children and child-rearing is an issue that cannot wait and cannot be postponed.”

Japan is not alone. Using United Nations data, we have identified 36 countries that are losing population right now, with more set to join them. The population explosion is ending, to be replaced by a global implosion.

More than 30 countries, from China to Italy to Japan, are expected to lose half their population, or close to it, over the course of this century. That number will likely increase as the years go by.

When our book Empty Planet: The Shock of Global Population Decline came out in 2019, we were derided in some quarters for predicting that the challenges of population decline, not population growth, would dominate this century.

Today, though different analysts offer different projections, the best-researched studies predict that the planet’s population will start to decline some time around or soon after mid-century.

The revelation that China, the world’s most populous nation, started losing people last year brought the issue into sharper focus.

In Empty Planet we wrote: “Population decline is not a good thing or a bad thing. But it is a big thing.” Four years on, we’ve changed our minds. We believe that population decline is a very bad thing, one that could define our future. If, that is, we have much of a future left.

How bad is it?
In the past few years, a number of countries have posted shocking population data. South Korea now has the world’s lowest total fertility rate – 0.8, more than one full baby shy of the 2.1 children per woman, known as the replacement rate, needed to sustain its population. China’s fertility rate has declined from 1.8 in 2017 to 1.0 or 1.1 last year. The total fertility rate (TFR) in the Philippines has plummeted from 2.7 in 2017 to 1.9 in 2022, the equivalent of almost one full baby. Italy, with the fastest shrinking population in Europe, has so many old people and so few young people that Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has warned “Italy is destined to disappear.”

Many people celebrate the environmental benefits of declining fertility. Fewer people on this Earth will ease the stress on the planet, helping to reduce carbon emissions and promote biodiversity. We celebrate this, too.

But a society in which fewer children are born each year than were born the year before, even as people overall are living longer, suffers the economic consequences of aging: fewer and fewer workers whose taxes support pension and health care systems; fewer young consumers to purchase the cars and houses and appliances and clothing that drive economic growth; fewer creative young minds to help us innovate our way out of pressing problems.

As societies age, problems multiply. They become collectively more vulnerable to infectious diseases, because immune systems are, on average, weaker. Infrastructure must be rebuilt to accommodate a frail population.

As older people seek to preserve their quality of life, younger people – especially younger women – struggle to meet the needs of their own families while looking after older relatives, even as they seek to preserve and advance their careers. “It’s a mental-health issue. It’s an infectious disease issue. It’s an aging-in-place issue. It’s a geriatric care issue,” Ellie Graeden, research professor with the Georgetown University Center for Global Health Science and Security, told us.

Facing the prospect of losing more than half its population over the next 70 years, Mr. Kishida announced the creation of a new agency tasked with arresting, or at least slowing, the loss of Japan’s population. That agency will confront three possible solutions, none of which offers long-term relief from population decline.

The Canadian solution
Countries that don’t have enough babies to sustain their population can turn to immigrants. Canada leads the Group of Seven in population growth despite having a fertility rate of only 1.4 because, since 1990, both Conservative and Liberal governments have recruited immigrants aggressively, with 465,000 expected to arrive this year and a target of 500,000 set for 2025.

Many countries, including Japan, don’t permit widespread immigration, preferring to preserve their cultural homogeneity. But immigration is an imperfect solution even for countries that welcome large numbers of them.

For one thing, we may soon start to run out. In 2001, China was the No. 1 source country for immigrants to Canada, and had been for a decade. Today it is a distant second thanks to declining fertility and a rising standard of living. India, which will overtake China this year as the world’s most populous country, now accounts for almost 30 per cent of all immigrants to Canada. But India’s fertility has been dropping rapidly and now sits at 2.0, below replacement level. The Indian government now expects that in about 30 years the country will be losing population.

Apart from sub-Saharan Africa, there are few places on Earth with fertility rates well above replacement rate, and even in that region birth rates are coming down faster than just about anyone expected. Kenya, for example, has gone from eight births per woman in 1973 to 3.3 last year, as African society urbanizes, girls receive more education and women have greater access to birth control. In the country’s capital, Nairobi, the total fertility rate is now down to 2.5, which is at or close to replacement rate for countries with higher levels of infant and child mortality.

And robust immigration comes with its own challenges. While they sustain economic growth and fill job shortages, the 500,000 immigrants who will arrive in Canada in 2025 will need somewhere to live, contributing to the shortage of affordable and available housing in the cities where they tend to congregate. They will also need a family doctor, increasing pressure on overburdened health care systems.

Thus far, Canada has integrated hundreds of thousands of new arrivals every year with little social strain. But if resources fail to meet demand, the strain could increase.

The Hungarian solution
A few countries with low birth rates and an aversion to immigrants are trying to pay women to stay home and have more babies. Hungary is the best-known example.

To reverse four decades of population decline brought on by low fertility, outmigration and anti-immigrant policies, Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government has greatly expanded financial supports for large families.

A woman with four children pays no income tax for life. There are also housing supports, child-care supports, SUV subsidies and other incentives. In January, the government unveiled a new program that would offer a lifetime income tax exemption for any woman who has a child in her 20s.

The program is hugely expensive: Five per cent of Hungary’s GDP goes to supporting families with children. And although the fertility rate ticked up in the past decade as the measures were introduced, last year it fell back from 1.6 to 1.5.

The most important reason, by far, not to emulate Hungary’s example is that it seeks to reverse decades of effort by women to achieve greater equality.

The Orban government has been steadily imposing limits on abortion. One recent report by the State Audit Office, titled Signs of Pink Education in Hungary? warned that highly-educated women had trouble attracting men, thus reducing fertility, and a preponderance of female teachers might be feminizing society, leaving people ill-equipped to deal with “a frozen computer, a dripping tap, or furniture that has arrived flat-packed and there is no one to put it together.”

The Hungarian Solution might better be called The Handmaid’s Tale solution.

The Swedish solution
Sweden offers the flip-side of Hungary’s approach. As with a number of other European countries, the Swedish government offers strong support for women who wish to have children without sacrificing their career.

Parents receive 480 days of parental leave. In a traditional arrangement, the father must take at least 90 of those days. Parents are paid 80 per cent of their salary to look after a sick child. Almost all children age 1 and older are in preschool. As a result of these and other supports, few Swedish parents say affordability is an issue when choosing how many children to have.

The downside? These policies are expensive, contributing to a personal income tax rate of more than 50 per cent. And they are only partly effective. While Sweden’s total fertility rate peaked at 2.0 in 2010, by 2020 it had dipped to 1.7 and the pandemic pushed it down to around 1.5 or 1.6.

The lesson is clear: Spending a great deal of money to support couples with children is partly effective, but not sufficient to create enough babies annually to sustain a population without immigrants, although Sweden accepts a large number of immigrants.

So how can countries increase fertility rates and reverse their population decline without relying on dwindling sources of immigrants? The short answer is: they can’t.

The low fertility trap
Simply put, once a society gets used to low fertility, it becomes irreversible. The phenomenon is known as the low fertility trap. A Pew Research study reported that between 2018 and 2021, the share of childless adults under 50 who said they were likely to remain childless increased from 37 per cent to 44 per cent.

Those surveyed cited medical concerns, financial concerns, environmental concerns and the lack of a partner as reasons they were childless. But 56 per cent said they “just don’t want to have children.” A large number of young people today enjoy the freedom of remaining childless and plan to keep it that way.

China has moved so far from its Draconian one-child policy, abandoned in 2016, that men are now encouraged to donate semen and women to give birth even if they are not married, which still carries a deep stigma in Chinese society. But the experience of other countries suggests these and other methods will fail.

There could also be an environmental component to the dearth of births. The environmental and reproductive epidemiologist Shanna Swan has been chronicling a steady decline in the sperm count of men – 1 per cent per year since 1972 – and an increase in miscarriages in women – 1 per cent per year over the past five decades – which she attributes in large part to an “alphabet soup” of chemicals in products used in everyday life that are impairing reproductive ability.

The latest research of her team, which includes data on sperm counts in men in developing as well as developed countries, reveals that the rate of decrease in sperm counts has increased to 2 per cent a year.

“We are seeing an acceleration in the decline,” Dr. Swan said in an interview. “The data is more alarming rather than less alarming.”

In the Pew study, of the 43 per cent of childless adults who cited a reason other than simply not wanting to have kids, one-fifth cited “medical reasons.” This is most likely due to the medical challenges resulting from the increasing trend among couples to delay childbirth until women are in their 30s and 40s. But it could also allude to chemically influenced declines in male fertility.

For all these reasons, then, we need to prepare for a future in which the elderly will steadily grow as a percentage of the population even as the percentage who are young steadily shrinks.

To address workplace shortages and protect pension funds, governments could raise the retirement age and introduce mandatory long-term-care insurance, with workers and employers contributing to funds that would sustain the elderly in their final, frailest years.

We might also need to start means-testing public pensions, with the affluent obliged to contribute to, but not eligible to receive, the Canada Pension Plan and other supports.

Some contemplate more drastic solutions. Yusuke Narita, an economics professor at Yale University who is of Japanese descent, has caused a furor by suggesting that mass suicide or mandatory euthanasia might be the best solution to societal aging in Japan. “I feel like the only solution is pretty clear,” he said in 2021. “In the end, isn’t it mass suicide and mass ‘seppuku’ (ritual disembowelment) of the elderly?” Prof. Narita later told The New York Times that his remarks had been taken out context, but he has repeatedly spoken of mandatory euthanasia as a possible solution to Japan’s large cohort of elderly citizens.

While that may seem shocking, Canada’s Parliament is examining legislation that would expand the grounds for medical assistance in dying (MAID). The Quebec government is planning legislation that would permit people who have been diagnosed with conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias to provide advanced consent for MAID when their condition deteriorates to a certain point. In Canada, being able to provide prior consent to be euthanized is only a matter of time.

Degrowth?
The long-term solution might be even more drastic: adopting policies of degrowth. This economic and social philosophy, which has been growing in popularity since the early 2000s, seeks to respond to global warming and other environmental challenges by abandoning growth-oriented policies.

In the introduction to a recently released book, Degrowth and Strategy, several of the book’s contributors defined their movement as one that “strives to reorganize societies to make them ecologically sustainable and socially just,” through “a deliberate reduction of material and energy throughput.”

In terms of personal lifestyle, that could mean anything from adopting veganism to eating only locally grown food to avoiding air travel.

In terms of economic and political systems, it could mean an end to capitalism, although such an outcome is not inevitable.

It does mean “addressing the growth dependency of contemporary economies, understanding those dependencies and then understanding how we can manage and reduce them,” Anders Hayden, a political scientist at Dalhousie University who researches growth and sustainability issues, told us.

This must mean “much more equity in distribution, more equity in ownership, so that people have enough to live on and states have adequate revenues to fund necessary programs,” Prof. Hayden said.

“It would require a radically reformed capitalism, and then we can question whether we would call it capitalism or not.”

This is not our way. We believe any shift to degrowth would be socially destabilizing, at the very least.

Yet some version of degrowth may be inevitable, as low levels of fertility start to undermine the foundations of growth. The massive population explosion between the end of the Second World War and today was unpredictable and disruptive; the implosion is bound to be unpredictable and disruptive as well.

We are confronted with this truth: Most societies are no longer able to sustain their population level, and the remainder are headed quickly in that direction. Unless and until future generations choose to reverse that trend, decline will define us.";Is birth rate irreversible?;"- **Population Decline:**  Many countries, including Japan, China, and Italy, are experiencing a dramatic **decrease** in population due to **low birth rates**.

523kfhxk;;;2bb51a9c;;;"As for forecast news within the 10 day period we can reliably predict, the predictions are making advancements over time. One such service is GenCast, a part of Google’s DeepMind program, which can allegedly predict weather up to 20% better than the ENS forecast, regarded as the world leader. This isn’t a trend of pure obsolescence, though; in the short term, GenCast is meant to support traditional forecasts by adding details like heatwaves, winds, and arctic outflows.

ENS is considered the world leader in forecasting, so seeing a new program outperform it reflects a new step in weather forecasting. Specifically, GenCast uses AI to analyze patterns and make predictions, training over 40 years of data and gathering relevant information. 

As of now, GenCast predicts weather based on 12 hour intervals in a timeline up to 15 days in advance, divided across the world in 28x28km chunks. The method relies on a new type of processor, a Google Cloud TPU, which speeds up calculations drastically. GenCast isn’t the only forecasting tool Google has made in recent years, though; GraphCast, the foundation of GenCast, alongside NeuralGCM (which uses both AI and physics) have been developments by the company. 

To clarify, GenCast doesn’t consider physics, at least directly, in it’s prediction process; rather, it compares current data to information in its database to make a prediction solely based on patterns it has observed. AI forecasting will thus not replace traditional physics-based forecasting for a while, as physical effects including chaos theory and the butterfly effect remain unconsidered in the AI logical model. Now, GenCast is being trained on “hindcasts” which map out mathematical theories to fill in gaps in data in an attempt to incorporate an understanding of physics.";;;GenCast: AI improves weather predictions significantly.;"- **Advancements in Weather Forecasting**: GenCast, part of Google’s DeepMind, predicts weather 20% better than the leading ENS forecast.

This article is more than 3 years old
The pandemic has seen audio shows fill a hole in our lives, providing companionship that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from the real thing

Some of my friends have no idea I even exist. These are people I know intimately, extensively, profoundly: I know what they had for dinner last night, the petty arguments they have at home, their obsessions, their insecurities, their fears, what time they wake up in the morning. No piece of minutiae is too minute, no idle thought too inconsequential, no detail too mundane: I want to hear it all.

If this is beginning to sound slightly alarming, I should point out that they tell me all of these things – and try to make me laugh in the process. I think of podcasters as my friends – and I am not alone.

Initially, I thought I might be. I have always taken pop culture to heart in an excessive way, much to the bemusement of those around me. But, to my relief, my actual friends seem to feel the same way about the podcasts they listen to. “Karen and Georgia from My Favorite Murder are my friends,” says one, when I broach the subject over text. “Yes, they’re my mates,” confirms my brother of the presenters of his beloved Tiny Meat Gang podcast, while a colleague says that the hosts of Trashfuture have “felt like my pals for a while now”.


The pandemic has, no doubt, expedited the podcaster-friend trend. After a brief dip in listener numbers during the first lockdown (something attributed to the change in people’s daily routines, particularly the absence of a commute), audience figures leapt up again – in December, BBC Sounds reported a 21% increase in podcast listening over the year. The number of podcasts also ballooned, filling voids in the professional lives of the hosts and the social lives of the listeners, and in some cases replacing both. There were periods during lockdown where I was hearing more from certain podcasters than anyone else on Earth – even the people I was sharing a home with.

But believing that people you encounter through the media are your friends is not a new phenomenon. It is called parasocial interaction, a term coined by sociologists Donald Horton and Richard Wohl in 1956. Obviously, they did not have podcasts in mind, but everything about the form seems perfectly pitched for such a relationship to blossom.

Podcasts are intimate, with no in-the-room audience to remind you of your own distance. They can also be very long, and very long-running, which means masses of information about the podcaster can be communicated and a network of in-jokes and callbacks established. They are often collaborative, fuelled in part by listener correspondence. There are a lot of them and the bar to entry is far lower than for other forms of media (everyone could be a podcaster; sometimes it feels as though they are). That means you are not only more likely to find a podcaster who shares your outlook and sense of humour, but also one who shares the material reality of your life. In other words, someone who might truly be your friend.

But can you really get to know someone just by listening to their podcast? Surely all broadcasters are putting on an act. “For us, it isn’t a performance,” says John Robins, a co-host of the Elis James and John Robins show (and one of my best pretend-friends). “Because I’m with Elis, and he’s with me.” The pair are, he says, “two men who are really good friends and who love each other – I think that’s what has made it strike a chord with people”.

This deep bond isn’t just a mechanism of the show – something that allows the duo to be “very authentic” in their conversations – it is also its primary subject and animating principle. Like the hosts of many other podcasts, the pair invite the listener to learn how their dynamic functions, preparing them for the glorious day when they become part of it.

This kind of vicarious friendship is something Robins is well acquainted with – to the extent that it has become an active consideration when making his own shows. “I totally got that feeling the first time [that I listened to a podcast]. I think I even sent Adam and Joe a soppy email at one point, just as a fan, so when I went into it with Elis, I knew what that relationship was like. We’ve always been quite conscious of looking after our listeners and creating a community around the show.”

That sense of community was much needed during the pandemic, but the shared experience of lockdown also benefited podcasts. As lifestyles converged and opportunities dwindled for everyone, hosts became more relatable than ever.

For Alice, who is 29 and works in PR, podcasters – in particular, the Sentimental in the City hosts Dolly Alderton and Caroline O’Donoghue – served as “replacement” friends during lockdown. They also simulated the casual intimacy of the colleague experience. Like the office, podcasts allow you to form “strong connections based on day-to-day stuff, but it’s not a deep and meaningful relationship”, Alice says.

The pandemic also meant that most friendships were conducted exclusively through technology, blurring the lines between podcasters and acquaintances even further. “We’re all starved of information,” says 32-year-old Steph, who counts the Nobody Panic hosts Tessa Coates and Stevie Martin among her podcast pals. “A story you’ve heard [from a friend] and a story you’ve heard via a podcast are coming in via the same medium, which is a disembodied voice on your phone. In a lot of ways, one isn’t any more real than the other.”

To blame the pandemic entirely for my own delusions would be unfair. In fact, thinking I am friends with podcasters is something I have done since I was a teenager (thanks for the good times, Adam and Joe). What hadn’t occurred to me was that my parasocial tendencies might betray questionable personality traits. Robins points out that podcasts provide friendship “on your terms” – and, crucially, at your own convenience. Steph describes it as a “lazy, selfish version of socialising – you’re getting what you want without putting in effort”. Podcasts also allow for companionship that is free of chaos and confusion; ideal for control freaks.

Yet sometimes podcast friends aren’t merely user-friendly substitutes – they can fill real voids in your life. Part of the reason I am such a huge fan of Rob Beckett and Josh Widdicombe’s Lockdown Parenting Hell is because none of my friends have children, so listening to the pair’s candid complaints feels reassuring and cathartic. Similarly, when nobody you know in real life shares your niche interest, some podcast somewhere will provide someone who does.

But even when they serve no discernible purpose, these fake friendships still bring much to my life: comedy, camaraderie, comfort, an expanded universe. As lockdown lifts, I have no intention of weaning myself off them. But I am also looking forward to reacquainting myself with real relationships: ones that are messier, more inconvenient and, actually, far less self-serving – even if they give me the opportunity to talk about myself for a change.";How podcast become our closest friend?;"- **Podcasts as Friends:** ️ Many people feel a close connection to podcasters, treating them like friends despite never meeting them.

We are plagued by a loneliness epidemic. In the last 50 years, regardless of geographic location, gender, race, or ethnicity, rates of loneliness have doubled in the United States. This increase has been associated with several growing concerns related to mental and physical well-being. T Yet, in a time in which it seems that we are more connected than ever before, how could this be possible? Could it be that our technological advances developed to foster connectivity are also affecting our loneliness?

In a survey exploring social media patterns, it was found that individuals who spent more time on social media every day felt lonelier than those who spent less time engaged in social media. Additionally, those who spent more time on social media in a given week felt more isolated than those who checked their social media less. An increase in social media use has been associated with increased distractibility and sleep disturbances. Researchers at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Radboud University Nijmegen have highlighted that we experience a pleasure response to social media sites such as Facebook. Similarly, Erik Peper, Associate Professor of Health Education at San Francisco State University, emphasizes that smartphone use can form neurological connections similar to connections that are seen in individuals with an opioid addiction. Further, in a study of 135 individuals, Peper and his colleagues found that people who utilize their phones more often were more likely to report feeling anxious, depressed, isolated, and lonely.

Is there a relationship between social media and loneliness?

In order to better understand how social media may be connected to loneliness, we must first recognize that it is not a simple equation. Just as there are a variety of reasons in which one may use social media, there are different ways in which social media could be fostering loneliness. The ease of accessibility may be causing us to connect more in the digital realm, but disconnect from the world around us. Researchers at the University of British Columbia found that even seemingly mild distractions from a buzzing phone could cause individuals to experience a decrease of present enjoyment. For example, if you’re at a social gathering and impulsively grab your phone as you feel the notification vibration, even if you do not continue to open the app, this brief moment could cause a feeling of disconnection with others present at the gathering.

The Center for Humane Technology highlights that we may experience a fear of missing out that causes us to compulsively check for updates. The persistent need to log-in can inhibit users’ ability to relax and replenish. Lack of adequate rest could cause individuals to become susceptible to mental health risks. Individuals may become glued to their devices to avoid feeling unaware of current events and feel disconnected from others. It is also possible to encounter unwanted updates that prompt feelings of isolation. For example, if someone finds a picture of their loved ones gathered for an event to which he or she did not receive an invitation, seeing this update could trigger the individual to feel excluded.

Exposure to idealized images on social media can also elicit envy. Falling prey to social comparison, individuals who were otherwise content could develop a sense of dissatisfaction by labeling themselves as less successful, happy, or adventurous. In a study of individuals who utilize Twitter and Facebook, participants who admitted to going out of their way to seek validation (e.g., likes) and to portray a perfect profile were more likely to suffer from low self-esteem and be less trusting of others. If an individual is focused on minimizing their flaws and concerns, they may lack the ability to relate to others about actual life experiences. Also, their own knowledge of their altered reality could cause someone to feel fraudulent and disconnected. Finally, their obviously skewed profile could cause others to feel a lack of connection as well.

Cyberbullying, including threatening messages, sharing private or humiliating information, or social exclusion, is a common cause for developing loneliness. However, due to the aggression occurring online rather than in-person, we may tend to underestimate the negative influence of cyberbullying. In a study of teens utilizing social media, spending more than two hours a day on social media made participants more likely to report cyberbullying. Similarly, in a nationally representative sample of 5,600 youth between the ages of 12 and 17, 34 percent admitted to being cyberbullied, and 17 percent clarified that it had occurred within the last month. Of those who had been bullied, 64 percent shared that it affected their ability to learn and feel safe at school. 12 percent of the students admitted to cyberbullying another person. Finally, cyberbullying is not always interpersonal. Digital self-harm, or self-trolling, in which an individual shares mean things anonymously about themselves online, is gaining attention. While the research is still new in this area, it is worthwhile to consider that some individuals who engage in this self-inflicted digital pain may use it as a desperate attempt to connect with others who will join in on the bullying process.

So, is it all negative?

There are certainly benefits to social media. For one, it does succeed in promoting the ease and accessibility of shared information. Social networking has been shown to assist introverted adolescents in developing socialization skills. Also, in a study of over 30,000 youth across the globe, it was found that students who utilize social media to communicate about school tend to earn higher grades. Social media allows for increased availability of resources for individuals who otherwise may not have had access. For example, social media connectivity can help an individual suffering from depression find resources and support to promote healing. Further, connection with the screen as a barrier can help individuals feel safer. For example, an individual may find it easier to get to know a potential partner through social media profiles rather than giving their phone number, address, or even meeting in person. Social media proves us with a new way to engaged, bond, and interact. Such platforms may provide the potential to fulfill our needs for connection and belonging.

Unlike other studies discussed earlier, according to the Cigna Loneliness Index, social media use was not found to be a predictor of loneliness. Additionally, Researchers at the University of Missouri and the University of Kansas found that social media use has no significant negative effect on social interactions or social well-being. Therefore, it may be important to consider quality versus quantity. Social media may be less about how often it is utilized, and more about the ways in which it is used.

A Flemish longitudinal study of adolescents using Instagram found that using the platform was related to feeling close and appreciated. After six months, Instagram use was related to reduced symptoms of depression. In a similar study conducted by Mai-Ly Steers at the University of Houston, Facebook was highlighted as an effective tool for connecting with friends and creating new friendships. However, over time, individuals begin to compare themselves to others, and this comparison was related to symptoms of depression. While the difference between these studies beyond the sample could be the applications themselves, in regards to loneliness, it could also be related to the user’s perception of connection versus comparison. Further, while some individuals’ comparisons may cause envy and depression others are able to utilize their self-awareness and self-assurance to transcend comparisons, maintain connections, and combat risks of loneliness.

Now what?

Individuals who are lonely may turn to the digital realm to quell their feelings of isolation. Hence, this longing could cause someone who is lonely to be more likely to develop a need to be more connected to his or her device. On the other hand, it is possible that individuals who are not experiencing loneliness may develop a sense of isolation due to the quantity and quality of their social media experiences. A relationship does not always highlight a cause. When relationships between social media and loneliness are noted in the literature, we may jump to label social media as the culprit. However, it is important to recognize that for many, social media can be a powerful catalyst in combating loneliness. For those who may experience loneliness due to social media, other factors such as self-esteem, trust, and sadness may be important underlying factors that warrant consideration.";A surge in one-sided relationship;"- **Loneliness Epidemic:**  Loneliness rates have doubled in the U.S. over the last 50 years, affecting everyone regardless of background.

A Psychiatrist’s Perspective on Social Media Algorithms and Mental Health
Considering social media’s growing impact, how can we create empathetic design frameworks to improve compassion online?

As of 2021, there are over 3.78 billion social media users worldwide, with each person averaging 145 minutes of social media use per day. And in those hours spent online, we’re beginning to see the harmful impact on mental health: loneliness, anxiety, fear of missing out, social comparison, and depression. 

Social media has undoubtedly integrated itself into society, but the question remains on how to properly negotiate our relationship with it. Nina Vasan, clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford and founder and executive director at Brainstorm: The Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, and Sara Johansen, resident psychiatrist at Stanford and director of clinical innovation at Stanford Brainstorm, explored possible answers to that question during a Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI seminar by outlining the impact of social media on mental health and psychological underpinnings of social media addiction, as well as possible opportunities to mitigate risk and promote wellbeing. Dr. Vasan and Dr. Johansen have worked with platforms such as Pinterest and TikTok to design and implement more empathic user experiences. 

What makes social media so addictive?
Variably rewarding users with stimuli (likes, notifications, comments, etc.) keeps them engaged with content. When a user’s photo receives a “like,” the same dopamine pathways involved in motivation, reward, and addiction are activated. What keeps us hooked on social media isn’t just the “pleasure rush of the like,” says Johansen, “it’s the intermittent absence of the like that keeps us engaged.” 

When does it become harmful?
One result of trapping users into endless scrolling loops is that it can lead to social comparison. When presented with the curated feeds of other people, we are vulnerable to “frequent and extreme upward social comparison,” which can lead to a number of negative side-effects such as erosion of self-esteem, depressed mood, and decreased life satisfaction. Some people try to cope with an eroded self-esteem by attacking other people’s sense of self, which can lead to cyber-bullying. 

Additionally, with advances in face tracking, facial recognition, and facial augmentation using AI, image-based apps have created questionable filters including ones designed to make a user appear more slender, which could contribute to distortions in body image. These platforms also offer “easy access to a community of people who promote and encourage disordered eating behavior,” says Vasan.

What are we doing now?
To moderate the vitriol of cyber-bullying, many companies have turned to AI as a method for classifying comments with negative sentiment and filtering them or prompting commenters to pause and reconsider their actions. 

Social media platforms are now working to ban communities that post harmful content. Many apps such as TikTok and Pinterest will present information on hotlines and support resources as a response to search queries for self-harm, suicide, depression, and eating disorder-related content. Moderation is still a complicated task as users find new ways to evade search filters, notes Vasan.

The psychiatrists don’t conclude that people must abstain completely from online platforms. For many of us, social media can be a rewarding experience that connects us with people all around the world. Instead of approaching screen time through the “displacement hypothesis,” which suggests the negative impact of technology is directly related to exposure, they recommend the “Goldilocks” hypothesis, which identifies moderate use as optimal for wellbeing.

On social media platforms, most risk mitigation methods are focused on non-maleficence, based on the principle to do no harm. Vasan and Johansen suggest that we should also consider beneficence, which is to do good. For example, Brainstorm’s recent work with Pinterest led to Pinterest Compassionate Search, which offers free therapeutic exercises on the platform in response to depression-related search terms.

What’s next?
Both psychiatrists emphasized a need for more social media-specific research, with even more granularity with respect to individual apps and not just smartphone use as a whole. 

They also recommend app makers consider more than the most simplistic business incentives. As we shift from “minimizing harm to promoting wellbeing,” Johansen says, it is important to realize that the friction associated with making apps less addictive “is going to come at a loss of some growth.” In the end it comes down to choosing that option because “it’s the ethical thing to do, because we have a responsibility to help these young minds develop in a healthy way.”";Harmful effect of Social media;"- **Social Media Impact:**  Social media affects **3.78 billion** users, with an average of **145 minutes** spent daily.

Franco Zacha for Vox
Tiffany Ng is a New York-based freelance tech and culture writer, exploring the ever-changing dynamics between capitalism, technology, and everyday life.


Just after the clock struck midnight, a man entered a nightclub in Istanbul, where hundreds of revelers welcomed the first day of 2017. He then swiftly shot and killed 39 people and injured 69 others — all on behalf of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

Among those killed was Jordanian citizen Nawras Alassaf. In response, his family filed a civil suit later that year against Facebook, Twitter, and Google, which owns YouTube. They believed that these tech companies knowingly allowed ISIS and its supporters to use each platform’s “recommendation” algorithms for recruiting, fundraising, and spreading propaganda, normalizing radicalization and attacks like the one that took their son’s life.

Their case, Twitter v. Taamneh, argued that tech companies profit from algorithms that selectively surface content based on each user’s personal data. While these algorithms neatly package recommendations in newsfeeds and promoted posts, continuously serving hyper-specific entertainment for many, the family’s lawyers argued that bad-faith actors have gamed these systems to further extremist campaigns. Noting Twitter’s demonstrated history of online radicalization, the suit anchored on this question: If social media platforms are being used to promote terrorist content, does their failure to intervene constitute aiding and abetting?

The answer, decided unanimously by the Supreme Court last year, was no.

The Court insisted that without ample evidence that these tech companies offered explicit special treatment to the terrorist organization, failure to remove harmful content could not constitute “substantial assistance.” A similar case in the same Supreme Court term, Gonzalez v. Google, detailing a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris, shared the same decision as Twitter v. Taamneh.

Both decisions hinged on 26 words, stemming from a nearly three-decades-old law: “[N]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”

​​Known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law fundamentally encoded the regulation — or lack of it — of speech on the internet. According to the logic of Section 230, which dates back to 1996, the internet is supposed to act something like a bookstore. A bookstore owner isn’t responsible for the content of the books they sell. The authors are. It means that while online platforms are free to moderate content as they see fit — just as a bookstore owner can choose whether or not to sell certain books — they are not legally responsible for what users post.

Such legal theory made sense back in 1996, when fewer than 10 million Americans were regularly using the internet and online speech had very little reach, be it a forum post or a direct message on AOL. That’s simply not the case today, when more than 5 billion people are online globally and anything on the internet can be surfaced to people who weren’t the intended audience, warped, and presented without context. Targeted advertisements dominate most feeds, “For you” pages tailor content, and a handful of platforms control the competition. Naturally, silos and echo chambers emerged.

But when a thirst for personalization exacerbates existing social tensions, it can amplify potential harm. It’s no surprise that the US, where social media platforms have intensified partisan animosity, has experienced one of the largest rising political polarization levels in a developed democracy over the past four decades. And given how most platforms are based in the US and prioritize English speakers, moderation for other languages tends to be neglected, especially in smaller markets, which can make the situation even worse outside the US.

Investments follow competition. Without it, ignorance and negligence find space to thrive.

Such myopic perspectives end up leaving hate speech and disinformation undetected in most parts of the world. When translation algorithms fail, explicitly hateful speech slips through the cracks, not to mention more indirect and context-dependent forms of inciting content. Recommendation algorithms then surface such content to users with the highest likelihood of engagement, ultimately fueling further polarization of existing tensions.

Speech is not the crux of the issue; where and how it appears is. A post may not directly call for the death of minorities, but its appearance in online groups sharing similar sentiments might insinuate that, if not help identify people who might be interested in enacting such violence. Insular social media communities have played a sizable role in targeted attacks, civil unrest, and ethnic cleansing over the past decade, from the deadly riots that erupted from anti-Muslim online content in Sri Lanka to the targeted killings publicized online in Ethiopia’s Tigray War.

Of course, the US Supreme Court doesn’t have jurisdiction over what a person in another country posts. But what it has effectively accomplished through Section 230 is a precedent of global immunity for social media companies that, unlike the Court, do act globally. Platforms can’t be held responsible for human rights abuses, even if their algorithms seem to play a role in such atrocities.

One notable instance would be Meta’s alleged role in the 2017 Rohingya genocide, when Facebook’s recommendation algorithms and targeted advertising amplified hateful narratives in Myanmar, playing what the UN later described as a “determining role” in fueling ethnic strife that instigated mass violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. While the company has since taken steps to improve the enforcement of its community standards, it continues to escape liability for such disasters under Section 230 protection.

One thing is clear: To see regulation only as an issue of speech or content moderation would mean disregarding any and all technological developments of the past two decades. Considering the past and ongoing social media-fueled atrocities, it is reasonable to assume that companies know their practices are harmful. The question initially posed by Twitter v. Taamneh then becomes a two-parter: If companies are aware of how their platforms cause harm, where should we draw the line on immunity?

Myanmar’s walled garden and the many lives of online speech
The rapid adoption of Facebook when it entered Myanmar in the 2010s offers a poignant example of the pitfalls of unbridled connectivity.

Until fairly recently, Myanmar was one of the least digitally connected states on the planet. Its telecommunications market was largely state-owned, where government censorship and propaganda were prevalent. But in 2011, the deregulation of telecommunications made phones and internet access much more accessible, and Facebook found instant popularity.

“People were using Facebook because it was well-suited to their needs,” anthropologist Matt Schissler said. By 2013, Facebook was Myanmar’s de facto internet, Schissler added. In 2016, the Free Basics program, an app that provided “free” internet access via a Facebook-centric version of the internet, was launched.

Myanmar is a military-ruled, Buddhist-majority state with a demonstrated history of human rights abuses — and in particular, a record of discrimination against Muslim populations since at least 1948, when Myanmar, then called Burma, gained independence. As a result, the Rohingya — the largest Muslim population in the country — have long been a target of persecution by the Myanmar government.

In the process of connecting millions of people in just a few years, anthropologists and human rights experts say Facebook inadvertently helped exacerbate growing tensions against the Rohingya. It took very little time for hateful posts — often featuring explicit death threats — to proliferate.

Then came the Rohingya genocide that began in 2017 — an ongoing series of military-sanctioned persecutions against the Rohingya that have resulted in over 25,000 deaths and an exodus of over 700,000 refugees. Anti-Rohingya posts on Facebook were gaining traction, and at the same time, reports from the Rohingyas of rape, killings, and arson by security forces grew. Myanmar’s military and Buddhist extremist groups like the MaBaTha were among the many anti-Muslim groups posting false rape accusations and calling the Rohingya minority “dogs,” among other dehumanizing messages.

In a 2022 report, Amnesty International accused Facebook’s newsfeed ranking algorithms of acting to significantly amplify hateful narratives, actively surfacing “some of the most egregious posts advocating violence, discrimination, and genocide against the Rohingya.”

The Amnesty International report heavily referenced findings from the UN’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, outlining how Facebook’s features, along with the company’s excessive data-mining practices, not only enabled bad-faith actors to target select groups but also created financial incentives for anti-Rohingya clickbait.

“Facebook’s signature features played a central role in the creation of an environment of violence,” said Pat de Brún, the report’s author and the head of big tech accountability and deputy director at Amnesty International. “From the Facebook Files leaked by Frances Haugen, we found that Facebook played a far more active and substantial role in facilitating and contributing to the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya.”

Facebook, hosting nearly 15 million active users in Myanmar at the time, also operated with a malfunctioning translation algorithm and only four Burmese-speaking content moderators — a disastrous combination. Drowning in the sheer quantity of posts, moderators more often than not failed to detect or remove the majority of the explicitly anti-Rohingya disinformation and hate speech on its platform.

In one case, a post in Burmese that read: “Kill all the kalars that you see in Myanmar; none of them should be left alive,” was translated to “I shouldn’t have a rainbow in Myanmar,” by Facebook’s English translation algorithm. (“Kalar’’ is a commonly used slur in Myanmar for people with darker skin, including Muslims like the Rohingya.) If a moderator who encountered such a post wasn’t one of the company’s four Burmese speakers, a post that’s equally if not more inflammatory would go undetected, freely circulating.

Facebook’s reported failure to detect hate speech was only one small part of the platform’s role in the Rohingya genocide, according to the report. Facebook’s recommendation algorithms acted to ensure that whatever slipped through the cracks in moderation found an audience. According to Amnesty International’s investigation, Facebook reportedly surfaced hateful content to insulated online communities seeking affirmations for their hateful positions — all in the service of engagement. Between Facebook’s market entry and the mass atrocities of 2017, the UN’s investigation found that some of the most followed users on the platform in Myanmar were military generals posting anti-Rohingya content.

Hate speech was not the only type of speech that engagement-optimizing algorithms amplified. “There’s hate speech, but there’s also fear speech,” said David Simon, director of the genocide studies program at Yale University.

Forcing formerly neutral actors to take sides is a common tactic in genocidal campaigns, Simon said. Core to the Burmese military’s information operations was “targeting non-Rohingya Burmese who had relationships with Rohingya people,” Simon said. In doing so, militant groups framed violence against the Rohingya as acts of nationalism — and, consequently, inaction as treason. Reuters’ 2018 investigation reported that individuals who resisted campaigns of hate were threatened and publicly targeted as traitors. By forcing affiliations, the Burmese military was able to normalize violence against the Rohingya.

“It’s not a matter of making everyone a perpetrator,” Simon told Vox. “It’s making sure bystanders stay bystanders.”

The context-dependent nature of fear speech manifested most notably in private channels, including direct texting and Facebook Messenger groups. In an open letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, six Myanmar civil society organizations reported a series of chain messages on Facebook’s messaging platform that were sent to falsely warn Buddhist communities of “jihad” attacks, while simultaneously notifying Muslim groups about anti-Muslim protests.

While hate speech, considered in isolation, explicitly violates Facebook’s community guidelines, fear speech, taken out of context, often does not. “Fear speech would not get picked up by automatic detection systems,” Simon said.

Nor can Meta claim it had no advance notice of what might unfold in Myanmar. Prior to the 2017 military-sanctioned attacks in northern Rakhine state, Meta reportedly received multiple direct warnings from activists and experts flagging ongoing campaigns of hate and cautioning of an emergent mass atrocity in Myanmar. These warnings were made as early as 2012 and persisted until 2017, taking shape in meetings with Meta representatives and conferences with activists and academics at Meta’s Menlo Park headquarters.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has published several reports in the years since about current policies and updates in Myanmar, including that it significantly increased investments there to help with moderation, in addition to banning the military (Tatmadaw) and other military-controlled entities from Facebook and Instagram.

The internet is nothing like a bookstore
The Rohingya are not recognized as an official ethnic group and have been denied citizenship since 1982. A majority of stateless Rohingya refugees (98 percent) live in Bangladesh and Malaysia. Being a population with little to no legal protection, the Rohingya have very few pathways for reparations under Myanmar law.

On the international stage, issues of jurisdiction have also complicated Meta’s liability. Not only is Myanmar not a signatory of the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to address acts of genocide, among other war crimes and crimes against humanity, the ICC is not designed to try corporations. Ultimately, the closest anyone can get to corporate accountability is in the US, where most of these platforms are based but are effectively protected under Section 230.

Section 230 was written for an internet that did not have recommendation algorithms or targeting capabilities, and yet, many platform regulation cases today cite Section 230 as their primary defense. The bill grounds itself in the analogy of a bookkeeper and a bookstore, which is now a far cry from the current state of our internet.

In the landmark First Amendment case Smith v. California, which involved a man convicted of violating a Los Angeles ordinance against possessing obscene books at a bookstore, the Supreme Court ruled in 1959 that expecting a bookstore owner to be thoroughly knowledgeable about all the contents of their inventory would be unreasonable. The court also ruled that making bookstore owners liable for the material they sell would drive precautionary censorship that ultimately limits the public’s access to books.

The internet in 1996, much like a bookstore, had a diverse abundance of content, and then-Reps. Chris Cox and Ron Wyden, of California and Oregon respectively, saw a meaningful parallel. They decided to take the Court’s bookstore analogy one step further when they framed Section 230: Not only should online platforms have free rein to moderate, but pitting websites with better, “safer” curations against each other would also create monetary incentives for moderation.

Today, the concentration of users on a handful of social media platforms shows that real competition is long gone. Social media companies, without such competition, lose incentive to maintain safe environments for site visitors. Instead, they’re motivated to monetize attention and keep users on the platform for as long as possible, whether via invasive ad targeting or personalizing recommended information.

These developments have complicated the original analogy. If entering a platform like Facebook were akin to entering a bookstore, that bookstore would only have a personalized display shelf available, stocked with selections based on personal reading histories.

Today, the bounds of Section 230 are painfully clear, yet that law still effectively bars activist groups, victims, and even countries from trying to hold Meta accountable for its role in various human rights abuses.

Section 230 has prevented the landscape of platform regulation from expanding beyond a neverending debate on free speech. It continues to treat social media companies as neutral distributors of information, failing to account for the multifaceted threats of data-driven targeted advertising, engagement-based newsfeed rankings, and other threatening emergent features.

Although platforms do voluntarily enforce independently authored community guidelines, legally speaking, there is little to no theory of harm for social media platforms and thus no duty of care framework. In the same way landlords are responsible for providing lead-free water for their tenants, social media platforms should have the legal duty to protect their users from the weaponization of their platforms, alongside disinformation and harmful content — or in the case of Myanmar, military-driven information operations and amplified narratives of hate. Social media companies should be legally obligated to conduct due diligence and institute safeguards — beyond effective content moderation algorithms — before operating anywhere, akin to car manufacturers installing and testing road safety features before putting a car on the market.

“It’s not that companies like Facebook intentionally want to cause harm,” Schissler said. “It’s just that they’re negligent.”

The way forward
What needs to change is both our awareness of how social media companies work and the law’s understanding of how platforms cause harm.

“Human rights due diligence as it is currently practiced focuses narrowly on discrete harms,” said André Dao, a postdoctoral research fellow studying global corporations and international law at Melbourne Law School. He said internationally recognized frameworks designed to prevent and remedy human rights abuses committed in business operations only address direct harms and overlook indirect but equally dire threats.

In a Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) report that Meta commissioned in 2018 about its operations in Myanmar, BSR — a corporate consultancy — narrowly attributed human rights abuses to Meta’s limited control over bad actors and Myanmar’s allegedly low rate of digital literacy. The report recommended better content moderation systems, neglecting a core catalyst of the genocide: Facebook’s recommendation algorithms.

Giving users more agency, as Brún notes in the Amnesty report, is also critical in minimizing the effects of personalized echo chambers. He advocates for more stringent data privacy practices, proposing a model where users can choose whether to let companies collect their data and whether the collected data is fed into a recommendation algorithm that curates their newsfeeds. To Brún, the bottom line is effective government regulation: “We cannot leave companies to their own devices. There needs to be oversight on how these platforms work.”

Between fueling Russia’s propaganda campaigns and amplifying extremist narratives in the Israel-Hamas war, the current lack of social media regulation rewards harmful and exploitative business practices. It leaves victims no clear paths for accountability or remediation.

Since the Rohingya genocide began in 2017, much of the internet has changed: Hyperrealistic deepfakes proliferate, and the internet has started sharing much of its real estate with content generated by artificial intelligence. Technology is developing in ways that make verifying information more difficult, even as social media companies are doubling down on the same engagement-maximizing algorithms and targeting mechanisms that played a role in the genocide in Myanmar.

Then, of course, there’s the concern about censorship. As Vox has previously reported in the past, changes to Section 230 might engender an overcorrection: the censorship of millions of social media users who aren’t engaging in hate speech. “The likelihood that nine lawyers in black robes, none of whom have any particular expertise on tech policy, will find the solution to this vexing problem in vague statutes that were not written with the modern-day internet in mind is small, to say the least,” wrote Vox’s Ian Millhiser.

But to an optimistic few, programmable solutions that address the pitfalls of recommendation algorithms can make up for the shortfalls of legal solutions.

“If social media companies can design technology to detect copyright infringement, they can invest in content moderation,” said Simon, referencing his research for Yale’s program on mass atrocities in the digital era. He said these new technologies shouldn’t be limited to removing hate speech, but should also be used in detecting potentially harmful social trends and narratives.

ExTrac, an intelligence organization using AI to detect and map emerging risks online, and Jigsaw, a Google incubator specialized in countering online violent extremism, are among the many initiatives exploring programmable solutions to limit algorithmic polarization.

“Tech isn’t our savior, law isn’t our savior, we’re probably not our own saviors either,” Simon said. “But some combination of all three is required to inch toward a healthier and safer internet.”";Who can take responsibility for Harmful content;"- **Social Media Algorithms:**  Algorithms on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google can **amplify hate speech** and extremist content without proper checks.

Many of the teens and young adults Don Grant, PhD, has worked with, both through Newport Academy treatment center and his Los Angeles-based private practice, are experiencing a stress that is directly related to news they have learned about through social media or more traditional outlets.

“They may have just read about an animal on the verge of extinction or the latest update on the melting polar ice caps,” said Grant, who is also president of APA’s Division 46 (Society for Media Psychology and Technology). They may not even recognize at first that the news has affected their mood. But, he said, “They’re perseverating on it—it’s bothering them.”

In today’s hypercompetitive and incessant news delivery ecosystem, slightly more than half of U.S. adults report that they get their news through social media “often” or “sometimes,” according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted from August 31 to September 7, 2020. To drive “clickbait,” news coverage and social media postings also tend to highlight the more negative or dramatic news.

This leads to suffering from, as Grant describes it, “media saturation overload,” and he is not the only mental health professional noticing this specialized type of stress. Similar terms that have emerged recently include “doomscrolling,” “headline anxiety,” and “headline stress disorder.” While these terms are newer, the psychological strain of living through and absorbing dismal news is by no means confined to recent years. But lately, said Grant and other psychologists, the steady drumbeat of headlines and related social media commentary has been without pause: an ongoing pandemic, racial injustice, climate change, election controversy, mass shootings, and the list extends onward.

Though there is no formally recognized disorder or diagnostic criteria, many psychologists are seeing patients suffering from news-related stress and seeking guidance on how to help them. Researchers are working to understand the science behind the condition.

Recent research studying news seeking and emotional responses has found that more exposure to the latest headlines—whether through traditional news outlets or highlighted on social media—can undercut mental health. One study, which surveyed 2,251 adults in the spring of 2020, found that the more frequently people sought information about Covid-19 across various mediums—television, newspapers, and social media—the more likely they were to report emotional distress (Hwang, J., et al., International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol. 18, No. 24, 2021).

Another study, conducted by Matthew Price, PhD, of the University of Vermont in Burlington, followed 61 young adults for 30 days and asked them to assess how they were getting their pandemic-related news each day, along with documenting any symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 2022). Price and his colleagues found an association between the amount of exposure to news on social media and more depression and PTSD symptoms.

To help patients cope in a world where news is omnipresent, psychologists with media expertise advise practicing dietary media restriction and taking steps to better process and rightsize the news in their personal lives. To guard against patients becoming overwhelmed, and developing a sense of learned helplessness, psychologists can encourage them to become more proactive in healthy ways on the issues that matter to them, added Price, the university’s George W. Albee Professor of Psychological Science.

If the news surrounding climate change is weighing a patient down, they could get more active in an advocacy organization or a local nonprofit working to address the climate crisis, Price said.

“What sort of values does the patient want to strive for, and then what can they actually do to achieve, to work toward those values,” he said. “Scrolling more on Twitter is not going to be in service of that value, or of any value that one might have.”

A proliferating stressor
The adults from the 2021 Hwang study, who also rated the frequency of their news consumption, reported on how often they had felt “anxious,” “overwhelmed,” or “afraid about what might happen” since they became aware of Covid-19. Overall, all types of news media consumption increased emotional distress, but television and social media exposure were more strongly associated, the researchers found. Younger adults and women were more vulnerable. People with conservative ideology were less likely to be distressed.

Broadly speaking, uncertainty is “a difficult psychological state for us,” said Markus Brauer, PhD, one of the study’s authors and a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Thus, seeking out information should “lead to a more positive psychological state,” he said. But when people feel like there is little they can do, such as when Covid-19 infection-prevention guidance kept shifting in the early months of the pandemic, they can develop a feeling of learned helplessness, Brauer said.

The research shows correlation; the study was not designed to assess cause and effect, Brauer said. “It’s also possible that those who are emotionally distressed turn to the news to try to alleviate their emotional distress,” he said. “My guess is that it [the relationship] actually works both ways,” he said.

By June 2020, 83% of Americans reported stress over the nation’s future, as they attempted to process dispiriting and converging news events, including economic turmoil, racial injustice, and the pandemic, according to APA’s Stress in America survey. That feeling of strain continued to be reflected in the March 2022 survey; 73% of Americans reported being overwhelmed by the number of crises facing the world at that point. Yet another survey snapshot, this one conducted in October 2021, found that a third of adults reported that pandemic-related strain was sapping their ability to make basic decisions, including about what to wear or eat.

Prior to the pandemic, most studies looking at the psychological effects of news turned their lens on acute time-limited traumas such as the September 11 terrorist attack or the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, Price said. But the ongoing exposure to pandemic news is different, he said, and still not understood in terms of its mental health impact.

“We call it posttraumatic stress disorder because we assume it’s posttrauma,” Price said. “What do we do when the trauma is still happening?”

The term “doomscrolling” emerged during the Covid-19 pandemic to capture the negative impact of viewing too much pandemic-related media, Price said. “It’s the transient feeling that one has when they are scrolling through these articles—they have a real spike in negative affect,” he said.

Price’s study found that the link between daily exposure to pandemic news through social media and reports of more depression and PTSD symptoms was stronger among those adults with a history of mistreatment in childhood. As one possible explanation, Price and his colleagues cited a prior study that posited that individuals might overuse social media in an attempt to ease their emotional distress (Psychiatry Research, Vol. 267, 2018).

But an emotional correlation wasn’t identified among adults who relied more on traditional media sources, such as newspapers or television, for news, Price said. He said that the heightened effect with social media sites might be embedded in the way they use news to reel in and retain their users.

“They’re designed to be limitless scrolling,” he said. “When there’s a big [news-related] topic of conversation that’s negative, it can dominate what you’re seeing. It can give the impression that this is the only thing that’s happening.”

Meanwhile, the changes in infection-control guidance and other uncertainties starting from the early days of the pandemic likely further solidified people’s information-seeking habits moving forward, said Chrysalis Wright, PhD, an associate lecturer in the psychology department at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, who specializes in media psychology.

“Covid drew our attention to the news media probably more so than before, because it was a worldwide health crisis,” she said. “It seemed like every hour there was a new headline.”

Installing media guardrails
Steven Stosny, PhD, who specializes in treating people suffering from anger and resentment, first noticed a surge in those symptoms, along with anxiety, leading into the 2016 election. For instance, many of the couples he treated were arguing more frequently, said the Darnestown, Maryland, therapist.

Stosny initially assumed the symptoms would fade after the election. But he soon realized that they had become chronic in some patients, a form of “headline stress disorder,” as he described it in a Washington Post opinion piece in 2017.

Although Stosny acknowledged that the disorder is not a formal one with diagnostic criteria, he has observed patterns of symptoms that are clearly connected to news exposure. “The red flag is if you get this body tension, or a rise in your pulse rate, just before you check the news,” he said. “Then you have intrusive thoughts about the headlines—you think about them throughout the day.”

Along with propelling anger and anxiety, the constant news exposure seems to erode one’s resilience, Stosny said. “It lowers your coping capacity, so things that normally you’d cope with OK, you are not coping with as well.”

Other signs include drinking more, or a diminished interest in activities outside the news, Stosny said. At their worst, he said, people can develop learned helplessness, which further fuels anger and other volatile emotions. “Whenever you focus on things you can’t control, you feel powerless,” he said. “Anger is really a cry of powerlessness.”

In this media environment, Stosny described the smartphone as a sort of drug delivery system, incessantly delivering news and other information. Research has demonstrated that a phone alert spurs a small release of dopamine, a powerful motivator, he said. “Your phone buzzes, and you are going to reach for it, if you are hanging by one arm on a cliff.”

Even so, Stosny doesn’t advise his patients to drop all links to the information ecosphere, but instead to moderate their exposure. “If you try to go cold turkey, your imagination of what might be happening tends to be worse than what actually is happening,” he said.

Grant similarly works with children and teens, as well as their parents, on healthy digital device management. Just as individuals with eating disorders can’t avoid food entirely, it is nearly impossible for people to bypass all media, he said.

Some strategies Grant suggests: Turn off all notifications, add tech-free periods to the day, and don’t bring phones to the dinner table. Limit social media checks to 15 minutes. Parents can model good behaviors by not constantly checking their phone. For instance, when they are waiting in line, they can chat with the people around them rather than stay glued to the small screen.

The payoff of moderating news exposure was reflected in the findings of a study conducted early in the pandemic during Spain’s shutdown. Researchers found that two-thirds of the 5,545 Spanish adults surveyed reported anxiety or depressive symptoms. But those who limited their exposure to Covid-19 news and tried to eat healthy, along with pursuing hobbies and more time outdoors, were likely to experience less stress (Fullana, M. A., et al., Journal of Affective Disorders, Vol. 275, 2020).

Better processing strategies
Psychologists can also help their patients size up their own perception of risk more realistically as they peruse the latest news, Brauer said. Rare events, like a lightning death, can get a lot of media play. “People vastly overestimate how likely it is that unusual events will happen to them,” he said.

Providing broader context, including about relative risk, is particularly important when working with children, said Jacqueline Toner, PhD, a retired psychologist and author of the Magination Press book What to Do When the News Scares You: A Kid’s Guide to Understanding Current Events.

Parents may attempt to shield their children from scary news like a mass shooting or extreme weather, and thus the children may only hear about bits and pieces of what happened, which may result in frightening misconceptions, Toner said.

[Related: How to talk to children about difficult news]

Psychologists can ask open-ended questions from the start, gaining a better sense of what the child knows, including context, Toner said.

If the child is worried about news that might pose an ongoing risk, such as wildfires that periodically flare nearby, work with them to develop an action plan, Toner said. What would they do, and who could help them in an emergency? Ask them to list all the people in their lives who could assist, not just family members but also neighbors, teachers, and firefighters, she said. “It demonstrates to the child that there is a larger safety net for them.”

One practice Stosny uses with his adult patients is to suggest they write down an anxiety-producing headline in longhand. The idea is to slow down the processing, hopefully moderating anxiety in the process, he said.

“Anxious thoughts speed by, and the faster they go, the less realistic they get,” Stosny said. “If you slow down the process by writing them down, they’re more realistic. And then you can assign a probability—how likely it is to happen.”

Uniformly, psychologists said that regardless of the patient’s age, encourage them to be more active in issues they care about, rather than just a passive observer of the news.

If a teen is fretting about the looming extinction of an animal, they can get involved in an organization trying to save it, Grant said. “Be a part of the solution, which will bind your anxiety, and it will make you feel not so powerless [or] that the world is spinning off its axis,” he said.

And it’s not just patients who suffer from media oversaturation stress, Price noted. Early this year, Price realized that amid his habit of scrolling Twitter, he was too often soaking up “the deluge of negativity,” as he described it.

“I became aware that, to put it clinically, it was bumming me out,” he said, with a short laugh. So, he scaled back dramatically, with only occasional posts to support his students or to quip about the challenges of parenting young children. After just several days, Price said, “I had turned the temperature down on my despair and outrage.”";Media overload on Stress;"- **Media Overload:**  Constant access to news can lead to **stress** and **anxiety** among teens and young adults.

13 May 2020

Zaria Gorvett
The latest research suggests that the news can shape us in surprising ways – from our perception of risk to the content of our dreams, to our chances of having a heart attack.
Alison Holman was working on a fairly ordinary study of mental health across the United States. Then tragedy struck.
On 15 April 2013, as hundreds of runners streaked past the finish line at the annual Boston Marathon, two bombs exploded, ten seconds apart. Three people were killed that day, including an eight-year-old boy. Hundreds were injured. Sixteen people lost limbs.
As the world mourned the tragedy, news organisations embarked upon months – years, if you count the trial – of graphic coverage. Footage of the moment of detonation, and the ensuing confusion and smoke, were broadcast repeatedly. Newspapers were strewn with haunting images: blood-spattered streets, grieving spectators and visibly shaken victims whose clothing had been torn from their bodies. 
And so it happened that Holman and colleagues from the University of California, Irvine, found themselves in the midst of a national crisis, sitting on data about the mental wellbeing of nearly 5,000 people just before it happened. They decided to find out if that had changed in the weeks afterwards.
It’s intuitively obvious that being physically present for – or personally affected by – a terrorist incident is likely to be bad for your mental health. By chance, there were some people in the study who had first-hand experience of the bombings, and it was indeed true that their mental health suffered. But there was also a twist.
Another group had been even more badly shaken: those who had not seen the explosion in person, but had consumed six or more hours of news coverage per day in the week afterwards. Bizarrely, knowing someone who had been injured or died, or having been in the vicinity as the bombs went off, were not as predictive of high acute stress.
“It was a big ‘aha’ moment for us,” says Holman. “I think people really strongly, deeply underestimate the impact the news can have.”
It turns out that news coverage is far more than a benign source of facts. From our attitudes to immigrants to the content of our dreams, it can sneak into our subconscious and meddle with our lives in surprising ways. It can lead us to miscalculate certain risks, shape our views of foreign countries, and possibly influence the health of entire economies.  It can increase our risk of developing post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression. Now there’s emerging evidence that the emotional fallout of news coverage can even affect our physical health – increasing our chances of having a heart attack or developing health problems years later.
Crucially, just a few hours each day can have an impact far beyond what you might expect. Why?
Ever since the first hints of a mysterious new virus began to emerge from China last year, televised news has seen record viewing figures, as millions diligently tune in for daily government briefings and updates on the latest fatalities, lockdown rules and material for their own armchair analysis.  
But in 2020 these sources aren’t the only, or even the main, way that we keep up to date with current affairs. When you factor in podcasts, streaming services, radio, social media and websites – which often want to send us notifications throughout the day – as well as links shared by friends, it becomes clear that we are constantly simmering in a soup of news, from the moment we wake up in the morning to the moment we close our eyes each night.

Surprisingly few studies have looked into how this all adds up, but in 2018 – well before we were confined to our homes with a major global crisis unravelling around us – the average American spent around eleven hours every day looking at screens, where information about global events is hard to escape. Many of us even take our primary news-delivery devices, our mobile phones, to bed.
Hardwired affects  
One potential reason the news affects us so much is the so-called “negativity bias”, a well-known psychological quirk which means we pay more attention to all the worst things happening around us.
It’s thought to have evolved to protect us from danger and helps to explain why a person’s flaws are often more noticeable than their assets, why losses weigh on us more heavily than gains, and why fear is more motivating than opportunity. Governments even build it into their policies – torn between providing a positive or negative incentive for the general public, the latter is much more likely to work.
The news is accidentally warping our perception of reality – and not necessarily for the better.
The bias may also be responsible for the fact that the news is rarely a light-hearted affair. When one website – the City Reporter, based in Russia – decided to report exclusively good news for a day in 2014, they lost two-thirds of their readership. As the science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke put it, the newspapers of Utopia would be terribly dull.
Could this extra dose of negativity be shaping our beliefs?  
Scientists have known for decades that the general public tend to have a consistently bleak outlook, when it comes to their nation’s economic prospects. But in reality, this cannot be the case. The existence of “economic cycles” – fluctuations in the economy between growth and hardship – is one of the cornerstones of modern economics, backed up by decades of research and experience.
The view that the future is always worse is plainly wrong. It’s also potentially damaging. If people think they won’t have a job or any money in five years, they aren’t going to invest, and this is harmful for the economy. Taken to the extreme, our collective pessimism could become a self-fulfilling prophecy – and there’s some evidence that the news might be partly responsible.  
For example, a 2003 study found that economic news was more often negative than positive – and that this coverage was a significant predictor of people’s expectations. This fits with other research, including a study in the Netherlands which found that reporting about the economy was often out of step with actual economic events – painting a starker picture than the reality. This consistent negativity led the perceptions of the general public away from what the actual markers of the health of the economy would suggest. More recently, the authors of one paper even went so far as to argue that media coverage amplifies periods of prolonged economic growth or contraction.
The news is accidentally warping our perception of reality – and not necessarily for the better. Another example is our perception of risk.
Take global tourism. As you might expect, people don’t usually fancy going on holiday where there is political instability, war or a high risk of terrorism. In some cases, the news is a source of direct advice on these matters – conveying government instructions to, say, come home amid a global pandemic. But even when there is no official line to stay away – or rational need to – it might be influencing us through subconscious biases and flaws in our thinking.
One way this is thought to happen is through “framing effects”, in which the way something – such as a fact or choice – is presented affects the way you think about it. For example, a drug which is “95% effective” in treating a disease sounds more appealing than one which “fails 5% of the time”. The outcome is the same, but – as a pair of economists discovered in the 70s and 80s – we don’t always think rationally.
In one study, when scientists presented participants with news stories containing equivalent, but differently phrased, statements about political instability or terrorist incidents, they were able to manipulate their perception of how risky that country seemed. For example, saying a terrorist attack was caused by “al-Qaeda and associated radical Islamic groups” was considerably more concerning than saying “Domestic rebel separatist group” – though both have the same meaning.
Sometimes, these subtle influences might have life or death consequences.
A 2014 study found that the public generally view cancers which are overrepresented in the news – such as brain cancer – as far more common than they really are, while those which aren’t often discussed – such as male reproductive cancers – are seen as occurring much less frequently than they do. People who consume the most news generally have the most skewed perceptions.
The research, conducted by the health communication expert Jakob Jensen from the University of Utah, along with scientists from across the United States, raises some alarming possibilities. Are people underestimating their own risk of certain cancers, and therefore missing the early warning signs? Previous studies have shown that a person’s ideas about their own risk can influence their behaviour, so the team suggest that this is one possible side-effect. 
And that’s not all.
Intriguingly, the public perception of a cancer’s prevalence is closely mirrored by federal funding for research into its causes and treatment. Jensen and his colleagues suggest that news coverage might be shaping public perception, which, in turn, could be influencing the allocation of government resources. (Although it’s also possible that the public and the media are both reinforcing each other).
Finally, there’s growing evidence that the news might even infiltrate our dreams.
Amid the current global lockdowns, a large number of people – anecdotally, at least – are reporting dreams which are unusually vivid and frightening. One explanation is that these “pandemic dreams” are the result of our imaginations going wild, as millions of people are largely shut off from the outside world. Another is that we’re remembering our dreams better than we usually would, because we’re anxiously waking up in the middle of REM sleep, the phase in which they occur.
But they could also be down to the way the outbreak is being portrayed by the news. Research has shown that the 9/11 attacks led to significantly more threatening dreams. There was a strong link between the dream changes and exposure to the events on television. “This was not the case for listening to them on the radio, or for talking to friends and relatives about them” says Ruth Propper, a psychologist at Montclair State University, New Jersey, who led the research. “I think what this really shows is that it’s caused by seeing images of death – they’re traumatic.”
News is bad for us
Indeed, it turns out that wallowing in the suffering of seven billion strangers – to paraphrase another science fiction author – isn’t particularly good for our mental health.
After months of nonstop headlines about Covid-19, there are hints of an impending crisis of coronavirus anxiety. Mental health charities across the world are reporting unprecedented levels of demand, while many people are taking “social media holidays”, as they strive to cut their exposure to the news.

While some of this stress might be down to the new reality we’re all finding ourselves in, psychologists have known for years that the news itself can add an extra dose of toxicity. This is particularly apparent following a crisis. After the 2014 Ebola crisis, the 9/11 attacks, the 2001 anthrax attacks, and the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake, for example, the more news coverage a person was exposed to, the more likely they were to develop symptoms such as stress, anxiety and PTSD.
The impact of news is something of a psychological mystery, because most of it doesn’t actually affect us directly, if at all. And when it does, several studies have found that – as with the Boston Marathon Bombings – the coverage can be worse for our mental health than the reality.
One possible explanation involves “affective forecasting”, which is the attempt to predict how we will feel about something in the future. According to Rebecca Thompson, a psychologist at the University of Irvine, most people feel fairly confident in their ability to do this. “Like if you were to imagine winning the lottery tomorrow, you would think you would feel great,” she says.
Oddly, when you ask people how they actually feel after these “life-changing” events, it turns out they often have far less of an impact on our emotions than we expect. A classic 1978 study compared the happiness of those who had recently had their lives transformed by winning the lottery or becoming paralysed. The lottery winners were no less happy than the controls and only slightly happier than the accident victims. In short, we really don’t know our future selves as well as we think we do.   
The same thing happens during a crisis. Thompson explains that right now many people are likely to be fixated on their future distress. In the meantime, this mistake is steering us towards unhealthy behaviours.
“If you have a really big threat in your life that you're really concerned about, it’s normal to gather as much information about it as possible so that you can understand what's going on,” says Thompson. This leads us into the trap of overloading on news.
For example, those who thought they were more likely to develop post-traumatic stress after Hurricane Irma made its way across Florida in September 2017, also tended to consume the most news in the run up to it. Ironically, these people did have the worst psychological outcomes in the end – but Thompson thinks this is partly because of the amount of stressful information they were exposed to. She points out that much of the media coverage was heavily sensationalised, with clips of television reporters being buffeted by high winds and rain while emphasising worst-case scenarios. 
In fact, not only can news coverage of crises lead us to catastrophise about them specifically, but also everything else in our lives – from our finances to our romantic relationships. A 2012 study found that women – but mysteriously, not men – who had been primed by reading negative news stories tended to become more stressed by other challenges, leading to a spike in their levels of the stress hormone, cortisol.
“Men normally show quite high levels [of cortisol], so it might be that they just can’t go any higher,” says Marie-France Marin, a psychologist at the University of Quebec in Montreal, who authored the study. However, the women also had better memories for the negative news – suggesting that they really were more affected.
Negative news also has the power to raise a person’s heart rate – and there are worrying signs that it might have more serious implications for our long-term health.
When Holman and colleagues looked into the legacy of stress about the 9/11 attacks, they found that those who had reported high levels at the time were 53% more likely to have cardiovascular problems in the three years afterwards – even when factors such as their previous health were taken into account.
In a more recent study, the team investigated if the news itself might be responsible for this – and found that exposure to four or more hours of early 9/11 coverage was linked to a greater likelihood of health problems years later.
“What's especially remarkable about that study is that that the majority of people were only exposed to 9/11 through the media,” says Holman. “But they received these lasting effects. And that makes me suspect that there's something else going on and that we need to understand that.”
Why do events that are happening to strangers, sometimes thousands of miles away, affect us so much?
Holman has a few ideas, one of which is that the vivid depictions found in televised media are to blame. She explains that sometimes the news is on in the background while she’s in the gym, and she’ll notice that for the whole time the reporter is telling a story, they’ll have the same images repeating over and over. “You've got this loop of images being brought into your brain, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat. What we're looking at is not a horror movie that's fake. We're looking at real life things – and I suspect that somehow the repetitiveness is why they have such an impact.”
Holman points out that the news is not – and has never been – just about faithfully reporting one event after another. It’s a form of entertainment, that the media uses to compete for our precious time. Many of these organisations are dependent on advertising revenue, so they add a sense of drama to hook in viewers and keep them watching. As a result, the prizes for being the most watched are great. In America, news anchors are major celebrities, sometimes earning tens of millions of dollars a year.
Even when they’re reporting on already-traumatic incidents, news channels often can’t resist adding an extra frisson of tension. After the Boston Marathon bombings, coverage often appeared alongside urgent, sensationalising text such as “new details” and “brand new images of marathon bombs”.
Holman is already looking into how the news coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic is affecting us, though her results haven’t been published yet. “I really wish that I could say ‘I think it will be OK, we’ve got it covered’, but I do think there are going to be some lasting effects for some people,” she says.
Part of the problem, Holman suggests, is that global dramas have never been so accessible to us – today it’s possible to partake in a collective trauma from anywhere in the world, as though it were happening next door. And this is a challenge for our mental health.
So the next time you find yourself checking the headlines for the hundredth time that day, or anxiously scrolling through your social media feed, just remember: the news might be influencing you more than you bargained for.";The news change the way we think and behave;"- **Impact of News:**  The news shapes our **thoughts and behaviors** more than we realize.

Social media platforms are facing pressure to protect users from harmful content, particularly violent media.
Research suggests that children and adults can be traumatized by viewing excessively violent online content.
Awareness about potentially violent material may help us better educate, cope, and filter this toxic content.

Are you shocked by online videos?Source: benzoix / Freepik
In the news, CEOs of the biggest social media corporations were grilled by U.S. Capitol lawmakers about all the risks to children from their online platforms. (1) Under pressure from parents and politicians, social media companies promise to implement systems to protect identities, conduct age verification, and limit young people from accessing inappropriate content.

Parents are rightly concerned about the effects of kids being exposed to adult-only sexual content. Beyond pornography, another potentially toxic category is violent ""traumatic media""—extremely graphic and violent videos from crime scenes, wars, and disasters. Such images can be harmful to children and vulnerable adults.

In journalism, it is often said: ""If it bleeds, it leads."" Ratings follow the most sensational headlines, and gory stories of crime and violence often receive the most views. Historically, the ""news"" took days or weeks to arrive.

Today, video-sharing platforms supply instant, real-time images from around the world. This includes videos of violent events, now streamed to our digital devices. Videos of real violence—war, disaster, and crime—are easily accessible and widely shared.

What is the impact of viewing violent images? Whether by intentional ""doom scrolling"" or by inadvertent exposure, there is a real risk of media-induced traumatic stress. Traumatic media may trigger some people to experience severe distress, anxiety, or worse. This happened to me as I surfed a conventional news thread and clicked a harmless-looking link.

Suddenly, my screen was filled with full-on war footage. Violent images from a soldier's body cam, trench warfare, drones, explosions, and close combat are presented with a heavy metal soundtrack. At first, I was transfixed. Then I felt shocked and clicked off the aversive video. In this brief exposure, I was exposed to real scenes of violence that I did not wish to see but couldn't ""un-see."" There was no warning, just war digitally presented on my screen.

I am likely not alone in this experience. Given video-sharing apps' viral nature, millions of internet users may regularly view and viscerally experience upsetting images. This widespread traumatic media may be harmful to our collective mental health.

Faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, Human Rights Center reviewed the social and behavioral research on this topic. (2) For example, following the 9/11 terror attacks in the U.S. in 2001, journalists documented the negative psychosocial effects of traumatic media. Repeat exposure to violent images produced indirect or vicarious trauma. This ""media-induced trauma"" was noted by journalists and investigators who combed through hours of violent videos to document war crimes. Exposure to traumatic media may induce a kind of sympathetic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in some viewers. (3-5)

Perhaps it's not surprising that those investigating heinous crimes, mass shootings, wars, and disasters might report a type of PTSD from viewing the evidence. However, given today's mass access through internet video-sharing platforms, millions may be consuming traumatic videos beamed from crime scenes to battlefields. Those folks already dealing with PTSD or other clinical issues might be additionally triggered by traumatic media. Other vulnerable audiences, such as children, are not prepared to cope with videos of real violence on their devices. How can we protect ourselves from exposure to traumatic media?

Given the recent media attention to this issue, at least some (not all) platforms will soon provide age checks and warnings that ask viewers to voluntarily ""click to see hidden content."" This type of gateway should be universal for violent and other adult-only content. We continue to advocate for reasonable tools for those who wish to filter out traumatic media.

Users should also become more aware of the risks and which platforms, sites, and content you (or your children) are accessing. Finally, we can prepare mentally to tune out toxic imagery and tune in to our reactions to potential triggers for stress. If you must view traumatic media, learn to take breaks, turn off the sound, and talk or journal about your feelings about what you witnessed.

Parents can also speak with kids about the possibility of viewing unwanted videos. In much the same way we speak about ""stranger danger"" and other hazards of online social life, perhaps we must educate and engage each other to mentally defend ourselves from the toxic effects of traumatic media.

One concern is that vulnerable groups or children will be traumatized by toxic online images. A broader concern is that, as millions view traumatic media, it will ultimately desensitize us to horrific scenes of crime, disaster, and war. Perhaps we are better off remaining shocked and disturbed by violent media. Allowing ourselves to become desensitized could mean losing our empathy and humanity.

bbdebd3a;1ed69455;;f2db5daa;;History;;34324;"Divination is a universal phenomenon; it is found in virtually all cultures, and it was ubiquitous in the ancient world. Written evidence for divination goes back to the early 2nd millennium in Mesopotamia and is attested to throughout the ancient world, primarily the Near East, Egypt, the Levant, Greece, Italy, and China. Divination was forbidden for religious or political reasons in some ancient societies. Primarily for religious reasons, divination was explicitly forbidden in the Tanakh; nevertheless, it was certainly practiced in ancient Palestine, which is also attested in the Hebrew Bible. Despite attempts to forbid certain kinds of divination, specifically astrology because of its potency, divination remained pervasive in the Roman Empire and continued in use after the advance of Christianity. Research into divination blossomed in the late 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century, and many primary sources from Mesopotamia, Greece, and China were published for the first time. The momentum almost ground to a halt after the 1920s, to the extent that many primary sources remain unpublished even in the 2020s. However, interest in the many-faceted phenomenon blossomed again from the late 1980s onward, and an abundance of research as well as the publication of new, and newly discovered, primary sources have since appeared. It was for instance believed that divination was all but nonexistent in ancient Egypt, a picture that has now been thoroughly overturned by the publication of a wealth of new sources from papyri from the Roman period. Increasingly, the traditional boundaries between fields of study have been transcended, and interdisciplinary studies have deepened our understanding both of histories, purposes, and roles of the divination disciplines, and of the complexities of their practice. Divination is a means of gaining knowledge that is not obtainable by normal modes of investigation. It serves to handle uncertainty, it can warn or reassure a person, or a whole people, about what the future will bring, and it can illuminate what happened in the past. Only the supernatural can hold that kind of knowledge; humans cannot investigate the minds of others or see what is hidden by time. “Divination” is the general term for a myriad of different techniques to communicate with the supernatural in order to gain access to that special knowledge. “Omen” is the specific term for signs sent by the god/gods, whereas an “oracle” is the answer to a query. Divination can be divided into “artificial” and “natural” divination, where natural divination refers to prophecy and other kinds of theophany that usually are revealed in plain language or comprehensible visions. Artificial divination always relies on a hermeneutic apparatus; it can be a complex or simple code, sometimes combined with the diviner’s own intuition. In research, divination and prophesy have traditionally been treated as two distinct forms of interaction with the divine, but in the early 21st century there has been a movement toward considering them as two sides of the same coin, in line with Plato and Cicero. Prophecy is left out of consideration here.

General Introductions to Divination in the Ancient World
Divination is a cultural activity that serves multiple purposes and is attested to in a myriad of variations. The history of their manifestations, development, and cross-fertilization in the ancient world is still a work in progress. The first and still most generous introduction is Bouché-Leclercq 1899.

5k3hslghxi;;a8732dd3;6ad388a0;;;"A News Cycle can refer to two things. Either, it refers to the somewhat recent trend of 24-hour news cycles, or it refers to the time between the reporting of an issue and its follow-up edition. Both of these represent cycles, so I’ll cover both of them.

A 24-hour news cycle is, well, a news source which reports 24/7. It’s founded on the possibility of gathering information about a sensational event quickly, and these sources compete to report issues the quickest. This was actually mentioned in the 2024 curriculum.

The 24 hour cycle began with cable TV channels and brought a trend of faster-paced news production. The 1995 OJ Simpson murder case is sometimes considered the inciting incident which brought the common existence of 24-7 channels. It has been criticized for creating wild competition and prioritizing speed over accuracy or scope. 

Another definition for a news cycle refers to the the time in between the release of a recent news story and its follow-up edition, usually an opinionated piece with further evidence and bystander commentaries. It is linked to the cycle of releases in newspapers, whether they be daily, weekly, or monthly. 

In common practice, these news cycles (whether they be in paper or TV) are built around the schedules of the working class, developed to fit within the periods of 8-9AM or 5-6PM.";;;News Cycle: 24-hour news reporting and follow-up stories.;"- **News Cycle Definitions**:

    - Criticized for fostering competition that can lead to sensationalism.

  - **Traditional News Cycle**:
    - Refers to the time between the initial news report and its follow-up edition.
    - Follow-ups often include opinion pieces and additional commentary.
    - Linked to the release schedules of newspapers (daily, weekly, monthly).

No one knows more about the world of tomorrow than Michio Kaku.


Equal parts theoretical physicist, futurist, and popular science communicator, Kaku studies cutting-edge science and technology in order to understand the future.

A graduate of Harvard University and Berkeley, Kaku has spent 25 years as a professor of theoretical physics at the City College of New York.

His main challenge has been to unite the laws of our universe in a grand ""theory of everything"" — the same thing to which Albert Einstein dedicated much of his career. Yes, this seems just a little daunting. But Kaku's foundational contributions to string field theory brought physicists the closest they've ever come to actually achieving it.

In short: he's got real science behind him. Which gives him a unique perspective and background to predict what the future will be like.

Kaku's Take on Tomorrow
When most people look to the future, they envision a world in which flying cars soar high above us as we edit diseases out of our genes.



But to Kaku, one innovation looms largest, blotting out other sights: drones.

In an interview with Futurism at the World Government Summit last month, the topic dominated the conversation.

Kaku has been warning of the dangers of militarized drone systems for years. The threat of military drones, he says, is absolute. ""The only immediate danger is automatic killing machines,"" he said.

Those who portend a future filled with Terminator-style robots armed with artificial superintelligence ignore real and imminent dangers. ""That’s not going to happen for another hundred years, so I’m not worried,"" he said, and

Here's what should really give us pause, according to Kaku:

We have drones that a human supervises and says, ‘kill that target.’ In the future, the drone will recognize the human form and have permission to kill the target. It may go crazy one day—a mistake, a short circuit could take place—and it just keeps shooting that human form independent of any instructions. Automatic killing machines are the one thing we have to worry about today, not tomorrow. But other than that, we really don't have to worry about the robots taking over.

Kaku's Predictions Beyond
Here are some of Kaku's other predictions on a variety of topics:

Extraterrestrial Life: ""Within this century, we will make contact with an alien civilization by listening in on their radio communications.""
The Evolution of AI: ""Simple tasks done by humans are way beyond what a robot can do. But, as the decades go by, they will become as smart as a mouse, then rat, then a cat, dog, and monkey. By that point, they might become dangerous and even replace humans, near the end of the century.""
Colonizing Alien Worlds: ""We need an insurance policy, a backup plan. The dinosaurs didn't have a space program, and that's why they're not here today. No one's saying we should leave the Earth and go to Mars, but a settlement on Mars is a definite possibility.""
Bitcoin: ""You cannot stop virtual currency. As far as, 'what are things worth?' Things are worth whatever your willing to pay for it....so it's gambling. It's speculation. As far as my personal attitude towards it, it's not productive. Bitcoin is not a productive industry.""
Driverless Cars: ""As transportation is digitized in the next decade, driverless cars, guided by GPS and radar, will share our highways. 'Traffic accidents' and 'traffic jams' will become archaic terms. Thousands of lives will be saved every year.""";Michio Kaku 's Predictions;"- **Michio Kaku's Background:**  A theoretical physicist and futurist, Kaku is a professor at City College of New York and studied at Harvard and Berkeley.

  - **Colonizing Other Worlds:** Establishing a settlement on Mars as a backup plan for humanity.

Kaku has been warning of the dangers of militarized drone systems for years. The threat of military drones, he says, is absolute. ""The only immediate danger is automatic killing machines,"" he said.

Those who portend a future filled with Terminator-style robots armed with artificial superintelligence ignore real and imminent dangers. ""That’s not going to happen for another hundred years, so I’m not worried,"" he said, and

Here's what should really give us pause, according to Kaku:

We have drones that a human supervises and says, ‘kill that target.’ In the future, the drone will recognize the human form and have permission to kill the target. It may go crazy one day—a mistake, a short circuit could take place—and it just keeps shooting that human form independent of any instructions. Automatic killing machines are the one thing we have to worry about today, not tomorrow. But other than that, we really don't have to worry about the robots taking over.

Kaku's Predictions Beyond
Here are some of Kaku's other predictions on a variety of topics:

Extraterrestrial Life: ""Within this century, we will make contact with an alien civilization by listening in on their radio communications.""
The Evolution of AI: ""Simple tasks done by humans are way beyond what a robot can do. But, as the decades go by, they will become as smart as a mouse, then rat, then a cat, dog, and monkey. By that point, they might become dangerous and even replace humans, near the end of the century.""
Colonizing Alien Worlds: ""We need an insurance policy, a backup plan. The dinosaurs didn't have a space program, and that's why they're not here today. No one's saying we should leave the Earth and go to Mars, but a settlement on Mars is a definite possibility.""
Bitcoin: ""You cannot stop virtual currency. As far as, 'what are things worth?' Things are worth whatever your willing to pay for it....so it's gambling. It's speculation. As far as my personal attitude towards it, it's not productive. Bitcoin is not a productive industry.""
Driverless Cars: ""As transportation is digitized in the next decade, driverless cars, guided by GPS and radar, will share our highways. 'Traffic accidents' and 'traffic jams' will become archaic terms. Thousands of lives will be saved every year.""

The name is misleading, as the cycle refers to an entire economy rather than a specific business or market. (The term “economic cycle” is interchangeable, and is a more accurate representation of the concept.)

Unlike many other cycles, the business cycle doesn’t have a specific timeframe (ie 20 years for fashion, 30 years for nostalgia, etc. Rather, it represents overall trends over time.)

A business cycle is composed of a few parts which mark changes in aggregate product, or GDP. The 4 main components are as follows:

Peak: This is the top of a business cycle, where everything is all swell.
Recession/Contraction: After a peak, the economy trends downwards.
Trough: This is the lowest point in the cycle, where everything seems grim.
Expansion: This marks the recovery of the economy, trending upwards towards the next peak.

(Sometimes, a 5th component, “recovery”, represents the period where the economy trends upwards, but is not yet at its average value. This period refers to getting out of a trough.)

The period where a recession becomes severe enough to dip below a certain level (which varies) is known as a depression.

A cycle commonly associated with the business cycle is the boom and bust cycle, which characterizes a period where the economy moves up and down very quickly. Booms happen when people overinvest, and busts happen when people realize they’re overinvesting, and so on.";;;Business Cycle: Economy's ups and downs over time.;"- **Business Cycle Overview**: Refers to the overall trend of a nation's economy, also known as the economic cycle.

Legacy of the U.S. Auto Industry
The automobile was first invented and perfected in Germany and France in the late 1800s, though Americans quickly came to dominate the automotive industry in the first half of the twentieth century. Henry Ford innovated mass-production techniques that became standard, and Ford, General Motors and Chrysler emerged as the “Big Three” auto companies by the 1920s. Manufacturers funneled their resources to the military during World War II, and afterward automobile production in Europe and Japan soared to meet growing demand. Once vital to the expansion of American urban centers, the industry had become a shared global enterprise with the rise of Japan as the leading automaker by 1980.

Although the automobile was to have its greatest social and economic impact in the United States, it was initially perfected in Germany and France toward the end of the nineteenth century by such men as Gottlieb Daimler, Karl Benz, Nicolaus Otto and Emile Levassor.

When Were Cars Invented?
The 1901 Mercedes, designed by Wilhelm Maybach for Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft, deserves credit for being the first modern motorcar in all essentials.

Its thirty-five-horsepower engine weighed only fourteen pounds per horsepower, and it achieved a top speed of fifty-three miles per hour. By 1909, with the most integrated automobile factory in Europe, Daimler employed some seventeen hundred workers to produce fewer than a thousand cars per year.

Nothing illustrates the superiority of European design better than the sharp contrast between this first Mercedes model and Ransom E. Olds‘ 1901-1906 one-cylinder, three-horsepower, tiller-steered, curved-dash Oldsmobile, which was merely a motorized horse buggy. But the Olds sold for only $650, putting it within reach of middle-class Americans, and the 1904 Olds output of 5,508 units surpassed any car production previously accomplished.

The central problem of automotive technology over the first decade of the twentieth century would be reconciling the advanced design of the 1901 Mercedes with the moderate price and low operating expenses of the Olds. This would be overwhelmingly an American achievement.

Henry Ford and William Durant
Bicycle mechanics J. Frank and Charles Duryea of Springfield, Massachusetts, had designed the first successful American gasoline automobile in 1893, then won the first American car race in 1895, and went on to make the first sale of an American-made gasoline car the next year.

Thirty American manufacturers produced 2,500 motor vehicles in 1899, and some 485 companies entered the business in the next decade. In 1908 Henry Ford introduced the Model T and William Durant founded General Motors.

The new firms operated in an unprecedented seller’s market for an expensive consumer goods item. With its vast land area and a hinterland of scattered and isolated settlements, the United States had a far greater need for automotive transportation than the nations of Europe. Great demand was ensured, too, by a significantly higher per capita income and more equitable income distribution than European countries.

Model T
Given the American manufacturing tradition, it was also inevitable that cars would be produced in larger volume at lower prices than in Europe. The absence of tariff barriers between the states encouraged sales over a wide geographic area. Cheap raw materials and a chronic shortage of skilled labor early encouraged the mechanization of industrial processes in the United States.

This in turn required the standardization of products and resulted in the volume production of such commodities as firearms, sewing machines, bicycles, and many other items. In 1913, the United States produced some 485,000 of the world total of 606,124 motor vehicles.

The Ford Motor Company greatly outpaced its competitors in reconciling state-of-the-art design with moderate price. Cycle and Automobile Trade Journal called the four-cylinder, fifteen-horsepower, $600 Ford Model N (1906-1907) “the very first instance of a low-cost motorcar driven by a gas engine having cylinders enough to give the shaft a turning impulse in each shaft turn which is well built and offered in large numbers.” Deluged with orders, Ford installed improved production equipment and after 1906 was able to make deliveries of a hundred cars a day.

Encouraged by the success of the Model N, Henry Ford was determined to build an even better “car for the great multitude.” The four-cylinder, twenty-horsepower Model T, first offered in October 1908, sold for $825. Its two-speed planetary transmission made it easy to drive, and features such as its detachable cylinder head made it easy to repair. Its high chassis was designed to clear the bumps in rural roads. Vanadium steel made the Model T a lighter and tougher car, and new methods of casting parts (especially block casting of the engine) helped keep the price down.

Committed to large-volume production of the Model T, Ford innovated modern mass production techniques at his new Highland Park, Michigan, plant, which opened in 1910 (although he did not introduce the moving assembly line until 1913-1914). The Model T runabout sold for $575 in 1912, less than the average annual wage in the United States.

By the time the Model T was withdrawn from production in 1927, its price had been reduced to $290 for the coupe, 15 million units had been sold, and mass personal “automobility” had become a reality.";Early start to Car industry;"- **Automobile Invention:**  The automobile was first invented in **Germany and France** in the late 1800s, featuring pioneers like **Gottlieb Daimler** and **Karl Benz**.

Fire Paintings is an entry into his research on the fundamental elements, those being Fire, Water, and Air.

I’ve copy-pasted the quote Yves provided alongside the exhibition:

“Fire for me is the future without forgetting the past. It is the memory of nature. It is gentleness. ‘It is gentleness and torture’. It is heath and it is apocalypse. It is a pleasure for the child sitting prudently by the fireplace; yet it punishes any disobedience when he wishes to play too close to its flames. It is well-being and it is respect. It is a tutelary and terrible god, both good and bad.”";123123;"Consider the fire-related selections below, then discuss with your team: do they treat fire literally or metaphorically, and to what end?Talk also about the background, the author, special things about the work, how it is recognized.

d5f81f76;9b7d41ec;;1c47a043;;Music;"Joseph Haydn - Sinfonie Nr. 59 Feuersinfonie (Fire Symphony) is one of Haydn’s earlier works, written in the mid 1760s, though its exact debut is unknown. The symphony consists of four movements in a pretty standard form. It consists of oboes, horns, bassoons, a harpsichord, and strings (violin, cello, bass).

This symphony is known popularly as the Feuer (Fire) symphony, though the name didn’t come from Haydn himself. Rather, the name probably comes from the use of its music in the play Die Feuersbrunt (The conflagration), a play about a fire burning up some important building. Sometimes, the title is attributed to the symphony’s fiery composition style with a fast first movement, though there isn’t really much distinguishing this style from Haydn’s other symphonies.

The symphony, despite being No. 59, is actually one of his earliest.

Three versions of the arrangement exist, one made in 1911, one in 1919, and one in 1945. The one from 1919 is the most famous today.

The piece, made for the Ballets Russes, was created on a desire for distinctly russian music and design, something which had become popular with Western Audiences at the time. The ballet drew from various russian fairytales to develop the scenarios seen and its morals.

The score was received largely well (comments made on emotional character and implications were very positive), crediting the production’s success to it often times. It was successful enough to lead to sequels, Petrushka and The Rite of Spring.

Motifs, like Wagner’s entry, are used often in the musical arrangement. These phrases were so common in the melody it warranted the use of another name, “leit-harmonies”, an early example of reusing musical elements in different scenarios.

d5f81f76;50289bf6;;;;Literature;"William Blake - The Tyger is a famous poem in the English literary canon and tackles Christian symbols prominent in the late 1700s, having been created alongside a sister poem, “the lamb”. It’s part of William’s Songs of Experience collection of poem, published as a follow up to his previous Songs of Innocence. The poem is structured in 4 line stanzas of similar lengths.

The poem treats the “tiger” and the “lamb” as a sort of yin and yang, both counterparts of one another which are both required to have a complete world. The poem continues with these christian topics, with the question brought up of why God chose to make such a “fearsome, evil animal”. The tiger is also juxtaposed with fire, mentioning that it can look elegant but is dangerous overall.

Various interpretations of the poem exist, but they all revolve around discovering some kind of truth by seeing the contradictions and the opposites of existence. To understand one truly, you must understand the other. The ending of the poem leaves the topic open-ended for the reader.

This stanza is repeated and is of significance, as it poses the question of why God created such a fearful entity, standing it alongside the idea of symmetry.

	Tyger Tyger burning bright, 
In the forests of the night: 
What immortal hand or eye, 
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

The poem, as the collection suggests, was initially meant to be recited in a song-like style. This style has been lost since. The poem is meant to rhyme, though in modern English the scheme doesn’t make sense.

The poem paints out a POV of a character looking out onto a ruined landscape, implied to be by some sort of apocalyptic event associated with fire. The poem begins with the narrator fixed to a position, though they are able to traverse later on through vision. The speaker seems lost, akin to how lost I probably am with my interpretation. The end of the poem suggests that this point of view could be in a traumatic memory, though it is pretty vague - take my interpretations with a grain of salt!

Campfire remains from a South African cave suggest fire control by early humans dates back 1 million years.

Fire control changed the course of human evolution, allowing our ancestors to stay warm, cook food, ward off predators and venture into harsh climates. It also had important social and behavioral implications, encouraging groups of people to gather together and stay up late. Despite the significance of kindling flames, when and where human ancestors learned how to do it remains a subject of debate and speculation. There is even little consensus about which hominins—modern humans, a direct predecessor or a long-extinct branch—first acquired the skill.

The oldest unequivocal evidence, found at Israel’s Qesem Cave, dates back 300,000 to 400,000 years, associating the earliest control of fire with Homo sapiens and Neanderthals. Now, however, an international team of archaeologists has unearthed what appear to be traces of campfires that flickered 1 million years ago. Consisting of charred animal bones and ashed plant remains, the evidence hails from South Africa’s Wonderwerk Cave, a site of human and early hominin habitation for 2 million years.

The researchers found the evidence in a layer of rock containing hand axes, stone flakes and other tools attributed by previous excavations to a particular human ancestor: Homo erectus. Characterized by its upright stance and robust build, this early hominin species lived from 1.8 million to 200,000 years ago. “The evidence from Wonderwerk Cave suggests that Homo erectus had some familiarity with fire,” said Francesco Berna, an archaeology professor at Boston University and the lead author of a paper on the team’s findings.

Other groups of researchers armed with remains from Africa, Asia and Europe have also claimed that human fire control originated very early—up to 1.5 million years ago. These studies, however, rely on evidence from open-air sites where wildfires could have blazed, Berna said. And while scorched objects were found and analyzed, the deposits surrounding them were not, meaning the burning could have taken place elsewhere, he added.

Wonderwerk Cave, by contrast, is a protected environment less prone to spontaneous flames. What’s more, an analysis by Berna and his colleagues showed that sediment clinging to charred items there was also heated, suggesting fires were kindled onsite. For these reasons, the team described the singed traces unearthed at Wonderwerk as “the earliest secure evidence for burning in an archaeological context.”

Scientists working outside the realm of archaeology—most notably primatologist Richard Wrangham—have persuasively argued that Homo erectus tamed fire, Berna noted. Wrangham has long been championing the theory that cooking allowed human ancestors to consume more calories and, as a result, to develop larger brains. He has largely based his hypothesis on physical changes in early hominins—for instance, a shift toward smaller teeth and stomachs—that took place around the time Homo erectus evolved.

“So far, Richard Wrangham’s cooking hypothesis is based on anatomical and phylogenetic evidence that show that Homo erectus may have been already adapted to a cooked food diet,” Berna explained. “Our evidence from Wonderwerk is consistent with Homo erectus being able to eat cooked food.”

Berna and his colleagues have been excavating at Wonderwerk since 2004, but more work is on the horizon, he said. In addition to seeking even earlier evidence of fire control, the researchers plan to investigate whether the cave’s Homo erectus inhabitants actually cooked—for instance, by checking for cut marks on bones, Berna explained. “More work needs to be done to exclude that meat was consumed raw and bones were disposed in the fire after that,” he said.

The Devastating Effects of Greek Fire
The unique characteristics of Greek fire, also known as sea fire, rendered it a formidable force in ancient warfare. It could not be extinguished by water, which only served to intensify the flames, causing anything it touched to catch fire. This made it particularly effective in naval warfare, where enemy ships were vulnerable to its relentless, burning grip.

Moreover, just the sight and sound of Greek fire could invoke terror among enemy forces, including the enemy fleet. The psychological repercussions of Greek fire were as significant as the physical damage it inflicted. The weapon’s devastating effects on enemy forces forced them to adapt their tactics and develop new ways to counteract its power.

The ongoing battle for dominance in the face of Greek fire’s relentless power had a profound influence on the trajectory of ancient warfare, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to resonate in historical accounts as greek fire remained a formidable weapon.

Naval Warfare
Greek fire had a significant impact on naval battles, especially against Arab fleets, and revolutionized maritime warfare in the Byzantine Empire era. Initially used to protect Constantinople against Arab naval incursions, Greek fire was launched from tubes affixed to the prows of Greek ships, targeting enemy vessels. The tubular projectors added an air of mystery to the already enigmatic weapon.

In several pivotal naval battles, such as the Battle of Gallipoli in 1416, Greek fire proved itself as a formidable force on the high seas. The weapon was particularly effective during the First Arab Siege of Constantinople in 678 C.E. and the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople from 717-718 C.E., causing extensive damage to the Arab fleet and protecting the Byzantine Empire.

The profound impact Greek fire had on naval warfare is beyond measure. Its ability to devastate enemy fleets and thwart their advances changed the course of numerous conflicts, ensuring the survival of the Byzantine Empire and its capital city, Constantinople. The weapon’s potency and strategic advantage solidified its place in history as a game-changer in the realm of naval combat.

Siege Defense
Greek fire served not only as a powerful weapon in naval battles, but also as a practical means of safeguarding cities and fortresses from enemy assaults. It was utilized to incinerate siege towers and repel invaders, playing a major role in concluding the First Arab Siege of Constantinople in 678 C.E. The cheirosiphon, a hand siphon, was employed both offensively and defensively, with the intention of burning siege towers and protecting against adversaries.

The versatility of Greek fire in both naval and siege warfare made it an invaluable asset to the Byzantine Empire. Its ability to strike fear into the hearts of enemies and destroy their advances ultimately helped preserve the empire and the Western civilization it protected.";About Greek Fire - Overview;"**Greek Fire:**  A secret weapon of the **Byzantine Empire** used from the **7th to 12th centuries**.

9ac12633;2ea7d796;;;;History;;34324;"Deployment Techniques and Innovations
The Byzantine military utilized various methods to deploy Greek fire, including tubes, portable projectors, and grenades. Pivoting cranes were used to discharge the liquid fire onto enemy vessels, while the cheirosiphon, an ancient form of flamethrower, could be employed by field armies for the purpose of disrupting enemy formations.

The development of these deployment techniques showcased the innovative spirit of the Byzantine Empire and its ability to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of warfare. From ship-mounted siphons to hand-held flamethrowers and throwable incendiary devices, the methods of delivering Greek fire evolved to ensure the weapon remained a potent force on the battlefield.

Tubular Projectors
Tubular projectors were used on ships to launch Greek fire at enemy vessels. Historical weapon enthusiasts John Haldon and Maurice Byrne devised a hypothetical apparatus consisting of a bronze pump to pressurize the oil, a brazier to heat the oil and the nozzle, encased in bronze and mounted on a swivel. This apparatus was utilized to launch Greek fire at enemy vessels, further enhancing its destructive capabilities in naval warfare.

However, the pressure that accumulated in the weapon could easily cause the heated oil to detonate, posing a hazard to the operators. Despite this risk, the tubular projectors were a critical component of the Byzantine navy’s arsenal, ensuring the devastating power of Greek fire could be unleashed upon enemy ships with precision and efficiency.

Researchers examined 15,000-year-old stone art and suggest the makers were inspired to show movement by dynamic lighting of the fireside environment

Replica Plaquettes By Fire

Survival wasn’t easy in Ice Age Europe. After a long and possibly dangerous day of searching for food, keeping track of wild animals, and finding ways to stay warm, these human ancestors likely needed to relax. But when they huddled around a fire at night it seems that some of them also prioritized a very different kind of pursuit—taking tools in hand to create art.

“Maybe it’s akin to Paleolithic TV where they sit by the firelight, chat, warm their hands against the fire and create things,” says Andy Needham, an archaeologist from the University of York.




Needham and colleagues believe that working by firelight may have been more than just a way to stay out of the dark. They theorize that the flickering flames ignited part of the artists’ creative process and were key to the way viewers experienced the work. In a study published today in PLOS ONE the team created limestone replicas and 3-D models of 15,000 year-old carvings, singed them by both real and virtual-reality fires, and brought a variety of ancient animals etched in stone to life. Proximity to the flames appears to ‘animate’ the figures, they suggest, causing the perception that horses and other figures move dynamically across the rock.

Needham and colleagues examined 50 limestone plaquettes, small portable stones of sizes ranging from iPhone to iPad, found at the Montastruc rockshelter along the river Aveyron in southern France. As the last Ice Age waned, some 15,000 years ago, artists here used flint and stone blades to carve rock surfaces with geometric designs and motifs, as well as a menagerie of ancient animal forms. Horses, ibex, reindeer, red deer, bison and chamois are prominent among the animals, which include just one or two possibly human forms.

The artists were members of the Magdalenian culture, hunter gatherers who lived in Europe between about 23,000 and 14,000 years ago. The Magdalenians, living near the close of the last Ice Age in a cold but gradually improving climate, produced a wide range of notable art, from decorated tools to engraved bones and celebrated cave paintings. Their works include those at Lascaux, France, which previous researchers have suggested were ‘animated’ by their own interplay with firelight. They may have also made rudimentary musical instruments. In addition to the plaquettes, the rockshelter yielded stone points and tools and some notable works of art including the famed Swimming Reindeer—a 13,000 year-old mammoth-tusk sculpture depicting two reindeer, nose to tail, that may have been made for purely artistic reasons.

Magdalenian plaquettes, thousands of them, have been discovered in sites in modern-day Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom’s Channel Islands, as well as in France. Those rocks from Montastruc, likely gathered by the artists from limestone cliffs towering above the rockshelter, show thermal fractures and cracking, and bands of pink discoloration resulting from fire exposure. These telltale signs left an open question: When and how were the stones heated? Was it part and parcel of the creative process by which they were carved? Or was it accidental, the result of some later exposure to a fire over the many hundreds of years the cave was occupied after they were carved?";Early Animation using fire in the Cave;"- **Ice Age Artists:** ‍ Ancient humans in Europe created art 15,000 years ago.

047d9df3;5aac889d;;;;History;;34324;"Finding out was a challenge. The plaquettes are priceless, delicate and now housed in the British Museum, where they can be viewed online. That means that archaeological context about where they were found in the cave was lost when they were originally excavated in the mid-1860s. So the authors turned to experimental archaeology in order to learn more about their likely history.

First the team created new engraved plaquettes, made out of limestone, and put them through different scenarios.to see what kind of fire source and exposure could recreate the telltale pink heat damage that’s visible around the edges of the originals. They buried some and lit a fire round them to mimic accidental exposure to fires long after their creating. Others were fired as if the stones were later put to practical use, such as the building blocks for a hearth. Still more were arranged in proximity to the hearth as if its light had been intentionally used to create and view the carvings.

The team then used image manipulation software to compare heating patterns on the replicas with those of the originals. The results suggest that the heat markings aren’t likely to have been caused by later practical uses, or by accidental exposure to a fire long after creation, although a few bone antler artifacts in the cave show such damage. Rather, it shows patterns that suggest the art was intentionally made and viewed while being repeatedly positioned in a circular formation close to the hearth, possibly for creative inspiration.

The researchers believe firelight was integral to the creation and consumption of the art itself. The flicking light creates a fascinating effect on the carvings, far different than they would appear under controlled light conditions in a museum. Instead, as it would have been seen in a Paleolithic cave, the flames give an illusion of motion to the engraved animals and other designs, making them dynamic.

“You can see for example a plaquette with several horses on it, and as the light flickers across the surface you see different forms kind of emerging, popping in and out of your perception, and it creates a kind of cool narrative of horses moving across the surface of the rock,” says co-author Izzy Wisher, a PhD student at University of Durham.


Wisher and colleagues used virtual reality to create a flickering fire, then used the orientation of real heating damage on the original plaquettes to arrange their 3D model counterparts around the virtual hearth in what they believe would have been the original pattern.

The irregular lighting shows brief, ambiguous glimpses of each animal form in the rock—a visual experience that encourages the human brain to fill in gaps and complete the picture.

Humans often see familiar objects, or patterns, in what are really random objects—like a face in the clouds or a dog in a piece of burnt toast. This effect, known as pareidolia, occurs because our brain is wired to look for these patterns. For countless generations pareidolia has helped us to survive, perhaps by allowing us to do things like identify a predator in the bushes.

Though pareidolia may have deep evolutionary roots the group theorizes that Ice Age artists harnessed it in a very different way to help the creative process. They may have begun by using features in the rock to form part of the animal forms, for example a crack that represents the legs of a large mammal. “Probably, when you’re looking at this rock in the firelight, you start to see forms flicker in an out, and sometimes people were kind of finishing those off,” Needham suggests. “So it’s not just all in the mind of the artist. It’s about negotiation, I think, with the form of the rock.”


Superimposing multiple forms of the same subject, say an animal, may have been an intentional way to help suggest animation. This effect has been employed in some Magdalenian cave paintings, in which some animals sport multiple heads or extra pairs of legs, stacked one atop the other. “It seems they were kind of playing around with this effect of the light to create these animated forms of art in the Paleolithic world,” says Wisher.

“The experiments suggest the same may have been possible with these small pieces of portable art,” says Jill Cook, curator at the British Museum and specialist in Ice Age art who wasn’t involved with the study. But Cook notes some significant differences as well. The plaquette drawings appear comparatively quickly executed and lack the finesse and elements of composition seen in Magdalenian cave art. And it appears that the stones weren’t always regarded as works of art.

At other sites they were used structurally, as paving or curbing, and even stacked against the back of a rock shelter wall as if cast aside. Paquettes also sometimes show signs of deliberate destruction, where they have been struck and broken, and burning could have been involved in that process.

“The important thing may have been the act of drawing, perhaps the summoning of spirits,” Cook suggests. That process might have been followed by acts of destruction, like deliberate breakage or fire damage, as if the plaquettes didn't matter anymore or even had to be repressed.


Though the carvings are thousands of years old, new information could be forthcoming. Cook points out that recent excavations at the Gandil and Plantade sites, which occur beneath the same overhang as Montastruc, have unearthed some similar objects, which could be compared with those from Montastruc to shed more light on how they were used.

The evidence suggesting that these remarkable carvings might have been made by groups of family or friends sitting around an Ice Age fire offers a fascinating glimpse of the life of the mind, as it occurred during an ancient and long vanished age. Making art wasn’t essential, like finding food to put on the table, but it may have been at least partially about finding some social time to sit by the fire and chat with friends or family, Needham notes. “This feels really human to me in a powerful way.”";Cave carving using fire;"- **Excavation History:**  Plaquettes are delicate artifacts, now in the **British Museum**, losing archaeological context when excavated in the mid-1860s.

By  AUDREY McAVOY, JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER and GENE JOHNSON
Updated 8:54 AM GMT+7, January 4, 2025
Share
HONOLULU (AP) — In recent years, occasions large and small — parties, Super Bowls, mixed martial arts fights, even Thanksgiving — have provided a reason for residents across Hawaii to set off illegal fireworks.

The increasingly sophisticated displays, loved by some and loathed by others, are so prevalent that some people consider them part of the state’s culture. They have rattled neighborhoods of tightly packed houses, started fires, terrorized pets and knocked a light fixture off the ceiling of an Associated Press reporter’s home, where it narrowly missed a child and shattered on the floor.

Each New Year’s Day, Honolulu officials publish a list of fireworks casualties from the night before, typically a litany of burns, shrapnel wounds or amputations. Sometimes there are deaths.

But none of the damage has matched Tuesday night’s tragedy, when a lit bundle of mortar-style aerials tipped over and shot into crates of unlit fireworks, causing a rapid-fire series of blasts that killed three women and injured more than 20 people, including children. Another person was killed in an unrelated fireworks explosion on Oahu.

Authorities and residents alike are now wondering whether the toll will dissuade people from putting on such shows in the future, or whether it will prompt more effective efforts by police to crack down.

“This incident is a painful reminder of the danger posed by illegal fireworks,” Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi told a news conference. “They put lives at risk, they drain our first responders and they disrupt our neighborhoods.”


On Friday, the Honolulu medical examiner’s department identified two of the women as Nelie Ibarra, 58, and Jennifer Van, 23. The cause and manner of death for both were listed as pending. The identity of the third was not yet confirmed, the department said in a news release.

The military, in response to a request from Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, plans to fly six burn patients to Arizona for treatment as early as Saturday. Hawaii has only one specialized burn unit and online fundraisers for some victims said they would need to go to Arizona because their home state’s hospitals don’t have the space to care for them.

Efforts to crack down on contraband fireworks have had limited effect. In 2023, lawmakers created an illegal fireworks task force. Based on the ease with which it seized fireworks, including three shipping containers in its first few months in operation, the state Department of Law Enforcement concluded illegal fireworks are likely smuggled into Hawaii on a daily basis.

The task force has seized 227,000 pounds (about 103,000 kilograms) of fireworks in all, according to Green.

And yet, the Honolulu Fire Department reported Thursday that there were 30 fireworks-related blazes between Tuesday and Wednesday, a 30% increase from last New Year’s celebrations.

Rep. Gregg Takayama, who sponsored legislation passed last year to tighten fireworks controls, said he remembers setting them off when he was younger and agrees it’s a tradition for many. But the ones he played with, including Roman candles, pale in comparison to those on the black market today.

“The kind of aerial fireworks that are being used now are really explosive bombs,” he said. “And so the danger is magnified.”

Charmaine Doran, the vice-chair of the neighborhood board in Pearl City, northwest of Honolulu, called the notion that fireworks are part of Hawaii culture a misconception: “They have been outlawed for all of my life ... and I’m pretty old.”

In her neighborhood, the fireworks ramp up after Halloween, exploding in the middle of the night until New Year’s. Doran said she can tell if there is a big mixed martial arts fight on TV because the booms begin earlier in the day.

Enforcement is complicated because people are reluctant to report their neighbors on a small island where “we’re related to everybody, everybody knows everybody,” Doran said.

People fear retribution, she added: “If I dial 911, they’re going to egg my house.”

That was the theme of some testimony to the Legislature last January. Beverly Takushi, a Pearl City resident, described once being threated by a neighbor when she told his brother to stop launching illegal fireworks in a show that lasted from 5:30 p.m. on New Year’s Eve until after midnight.

“It was the first time I was threatened not only by the danger of the aerial fireworks to my family and property, but also for my safety from this neighbor who accused me of not respecting his culture,” Takushi said. “He has since apologized, but this is the reason why no one wants to get involved and report their neighbors setting off bombs and aerials.”

Many historians believe fireworks were invented in China more than 2,000 years ago and their use came to signify joy and prosperity, as well as warding off evil. In Hawaii they are celebrated not just by residents of Chinese descent but all across the state’s diverse communities.

Takushi echoed Takayama’s point about the big difference between today’s large, professional-grade fireworks and the smaller ones of yesteryear.

“A string of firecrackers at midnight to ward off bad spirits is cultural, not loud explosives that sound like you are in the middle of a war,” Takushi said.

Richard Oshiro, secretary of the neighborhood board for Waipahu, known as one of Oahu’s hotspots for aerial displays, said he hopes this week’s deaths will spur a change of mentality about playing with explosives.

He said he tries to report them whenever he can, even though he knows there is not much police can do if “they can’t catch people in the act.”

Possession of over 50 pounds (about 23 kilograms) of aerial or other illegal fireworks in Hawaii is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Takayama noted the law now allows photographs and videos of fireworks to be submitted as evidence in court, but said prosecutions still face hurdles.

“We already have laws on the books. We need to find better ways to enforce them,” he said. “I mean we constantly hear about people who report on their neighbors using illegal aerials, but nothing is done about it.”

The best way to control fireworks is to stop them at Hawaii’s ports, Takayama said. Law enforcement has intelligence about which shipments contain illegal fireworks and U.S. authorities have the power to open suspicious cargo. The task force has made seizures but needs to do more, he said.

“We need to find ways to restrict the amount of fireworks that are coming in, because once they arrive and once they’re in the community, it’s very difficult to track them down,” Takayama said.

Authorities hope some will turn in their fireworks under an amnesty program. Green said in a video posted on social media that law enforcement will be at Aloha Stadium outside Honolulu to accept illegal fireworks on Jan. 11. No one who drops off fireworks will be prosecuted, he said.";Hawaiian Firework accident;"- **Recent Incident:**  A tragic fireworks accident in Honolulu killed **three women** and injured over **20 others**, including children.

Article By Kurush Dordi

As the Sun rises over the horizon and fills the sky with its magical light, a 2000 year old ritual is performed daily in the few remaining Zoroastrian temples of Mumbai. The priest performs a ceremony (5 times each day), tending to the flames of the consecrated fire, offering fragrant sandalwood and incense while reciting ancient texts venerating the holy fire, ringing a bell nine times, rejecting evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds. Such veneration of fire, however, is not distinct to the Zoroastrian community. Many cultures around the world have worshipped fire in different manners over millennia.

Sitting around a campfire on a dark night watching the flames rise upwards, emits a reassuring warmth. But a rampaging fire in all its fury drives fear into our hearts. Overcoming fear and fascination for this element, human beings have observed volcanic eruptions, and lightning that strikes the earth, with awe and respect, resulting in the veneration of the element of fire as a gift of the gods. Harnessing the power of fire for human benefit was an important milestone in anthropological history.

Interestingly eight of the ten books of the Rig Veda start with a song in praise of Agni the god of Fire.

An ancient Greek myth speaks of Prometheus, who disobeyed Zeus’s decree, stole fire from the chariot of the Sun god Helios and gave it to man as a gift. This act of compassion, in the interest of Man’s progress, bore grave consequences and he is said to suffer a terrible punishment. The international Olympic Games commemorate this theft of fire in the lighting and consecration of the Olympic flame with the help of the Sun’s rays.

On a different continent, an Aztec myth speaks of the god Nanahuatl who jumped into a fire, sacrificing himself to become the Sun to set into motion the beginning of the fifth age.

And more recently, fire played an important purifying role in medieval alchemy that employed a special oven, the Atanor, a symbol of transmutation of a substance into a different element.";Fire in ancient culture;"- **Zoroastrian Ritual:**  In Mumbai, priests perform a **2000-year-old ritual** daily, tending to consecrated fire five times a day.

f3df5c04;d8c098e4;;;;History;;34324;"Today, we look upon these civilisations as backward or primitive, superstitious in their understanding of life.

However, perhaps ancient pantheism was but an expression of a deep way of life that celebrated the profound connection between Man and the universe. So too, perhaps the element Fire has a deeper meaning symbolized by, and manifesting in, the physical fire that we see. As a symbol, it allows us to discover the invisible and essential aspect of reality that transcends the transient illusion of form.

Ancient esoterism seems to emphasise the value of the mental fire, said to bring about intelligence and the objective discerning capability between the essential and the superficial, much like the physical fire which produces heat and purifies a substance. In the same way mental fire is said to burn away the unessential leaving behind the pure essence.

“O Ahura Mazda, the most beneficent spirit and the bestower of good things in return for prayers! Do Thou purify me (i.e keep me away from wicked deeds), owing to (my) gentleness (or humility) do Thou grant me strength, on account of righteousness bestow upon (me) mighty power (and) on account of (my) good thoughts grant me supremacy.” (3) (Zend Avesta, Atash Niyaesh – Homage to Fire)

Fire in Zoroastrianism plays a vital role. Zarathushtra, in his prophetic revelation, gave Fire a universal role and metaphysical meaning. Atash (Fire) is called Asha Vahishta, Cosmic Fire or Divine Essence of Ahura Mazda (the Supreme Being) which resides in every atom of the Universe. It is the source of all creation and is equated with Ahura Mazda’s own Inner Divine Light, which crosses the limits of time and space. The fire which we see is simply the physical manifestation of this Divine Light and is considered the son of Ahura Mazda sent to the Earth, to move creation forward towards its final goal.

Hence, Fire in Zoroastrian theology is a symbol of an inner flame that is honoured through the physical medium of the flames that burn in the fire temples, and is a medium to reach out to the Divine, reaching always upwards to unity.

Fire then, refers to the inner illumination through which God bestows wisdom and courage to man. One prayer which devout Zoroastrians recite every day reads: “Who will, O wise One, give me protection, when the deceitful threatens to harm me, other than your Fire and Mind?”

The sacred hymns composed by Zarathushtra speak of the mental fire, “The happiness You grant has been promised…through Your mental fire and righteousness.” The words for “mental fire and righteousness” in Avestan are mainyu athra-cha, asha-cha which literally mean “through mind, through fire, and through Asha (righteousness).” [Yasna, Ch31.3] The universal laws of Asha govern and bring order to material existence and refer to the individual’s ethical choice, to align thoughts, words and deeds; principled, honest, beneficent, ordered, lawful living.

Today such consecrated fires are housed in Fire temples or sacred structures known as Dar-e-Meher. Dar etymologically originates from Avesta, dvara, (Sanskrit: dvara, German: Thor, English: Door) and Meher refers to Mithra who in Zoroastrian angelology, is the Yazata presiding over light and justice. So the term literally means ‘the door of light.’

Each of these temples consists of a fire consecrated through carefully conducted ceremonies conducted by priests, meant to unleash the spiritual energy of the fire. The Highest Grade of such temples maintain a fire that comprises sixteen different types of fire, and is dedicated to Verethraghna, (Archangel of Victory) and is called Atash Bahram.

All fires are regarded as warriors, fighting for the preservation of creation against the forces of darkness, not just on the physical plane. Having undergone the ceremonial purification each fire acts as a Talisman against the force of ignorance. As per Zoroastrian tradition, mankind thus shares with the angelic divinities the great common purpose of gradually overcoming evil and restoring the world to its original perfect state. The glorious moment when this will be achieved is called Frasho-kereti a term which can be interpreted as ‘Healing’ or ‘Renovation’.

In the 10th Century C.E., the ancestors of the Parsis left their motherland Iran and landed in Sanjan, (Gujarat, India) in order to preserve their religion. After establishing themselves for a few years they sought to establish a house of worship, Atash Behram (Fire of Victory). Having arrived in India lacking the ceremonial apparatus required, they sent high ranking Priests to Khorasan (Iran) and brought on foot the ritual apparatus (Aalaat) to be used for the consecration.

The rituals formulated for the consecration of fires appears in the ancient scriptures called Vendidad, 8th Pargarad (73-96), where it is prescribed that fires used by different tradesmen be collected, ceremonially purified, and then enthroned.

The 16 fires are collected from:

1) Fire from the pyre of a burning corpse

2) Fire used by a dyer

3) Fire from the house of a king or ruling authority

4) Fire from the potter’s house

5) Fire from a brick maker’s hearth

6) Fire of a fakir or an ascetic house

7) Fire from goldsmith’s hearth

8) Fire used in a mint

9) Fire from an ironsmith’s hearth

10) Fire from an armourer’s hearth

11) Fire from a baker’s house

12) Fire from hearth of a brewer or distiller

13) Fire from a soldier or traveller’s house

14) Fire from a shepherd’s house

15) Fire from the house of any Zoroastrian

16) Fire produced by atmosphere lightning

Each of these fires represents a different cosmic energy, to which it is linked through electro-magnetic currents, or invisible thermal waves, said to be generated by the spiritual alchemy of the consecration rituals. For instance, fire from a brick maker’s kiln is linked to the cosmic energy of Atash-e Spenisht (Fire of the Earth). Similarly a goldsmith’s fire is linked to Atash-e Burzin Mehr (Fire of the Radiant Sun). A consecrated goldsmith’s fire is believed to magnetically attract the Energy Burzin Mehr which resides in the core of the Sun. An Atash Bahram therefore, is a spiritual receptacle of cosmic energies.

Flames from each of the above fires are collected, and purified through elaborate ceremonies. To do so, a small pit is dug in the ground open to the wind, called a Pahadia, in which each of the fires will be placed. By its side, and in the windward direction, another pit is dug, heaped with myrrh, frankincense, and sandalwood shavings. The heat and the blaze of the fire from the first pit, is carried by the wind and ignites the heap of the combustible materials in the 2nd pit. This process is called ‘passing through one Pahadia’. Each type of fire must be passed through a prescribed number of Pahadias. For example, the fire of lightning is passed through 90 times before it can be used. Fire from the hearth of the brick maker is purified 75 times before it can be used. The final total of all the purification iterations is a staggering 1128! Additional consecration rituals are performed once all 16 purified fires are co-mingled for its further enthronement. (5)

The innermost chamber, the Sanctum Sanctorum, of the Fire Temple where the sacred fire is to be enthroned must also be consecrated. That consecration ceremony lasts three days. Through the use of Manthravani, chants, and through the dynamics of heat, conduction, sound, magnetism through fire, water, metal, the spiritual purity of the officiating priests and environment, and other occult aspects, these earthly fires are believed to release their corresponding cosmic energies which previously lay dormant.

The Sacred Fire, once enthroned, is metaphorically similar to a Kings court, wherein the King presides over his spiritual jurisdiction. The stone slab on which the fire stands, is considered the throne (Persian: Takht). Its ceiling in the form of a dome, is reminiscent of the celestial. From that dome hangs a tray, spoken of as the crown (Persian: Taj) of the Sacred Fire, the symbolic representation of a spiritual ruler. Spears, swords and cow headed maces adorn the walls of the inner chamber, signifying man’s obligation to fight moral evils and vices, with the help of the spiritual weapons of Truth to emerge triumphant.

The resulting fire, the Atash Padshah (Emperor), is venerated as a Divine Being with an energy and consciousness and is perceived as the actual presence of the life animating principle of Asha, Truth. It denotes wisdom, and dispels the darkness of ignorance, and bearer of warmth and the light of order and cosmic intelligence.  Devotees reverently apply its ash to the forehead to invigorate oneself towards the path of Truth.

In times when our own inner fire simmers ever so faintly, let us blow the bellows with all our might, that the flames might rise stronger. Where we face ignorance let us blow wisdom. Where we face hate let us blow love. Where we face despair let us blow hope. And where we face fear, let us blow courage. All will be well and we can sleep, rest assured no matter how dark the night, if our inner flame is kept alive.";Tools to keep fire alive;"**Ancient Civilizations:**  Viewed as **primitive** or **superstitious**, yet they celebrated a deep **connection** between **Man** and the **universe**.

Anthropology Museum
Mexico City, Mexico

9:29 A.M. CDT

THE PRESIDENT:  Hola!  (Applause.)  Buenos dias!  Please, please, everybody have a seat.  It is wonderful to be back in México -- lindo y querido.  (Applause.)  I bring with me the greetings and friendship of the people of the United States, including tens of millions of proud Mexican Americans.  (Applause.)
 
This is my fourth visit to Mexico as President.  This is my second visit to this museum.  And each time that I've come I’ve been inspired by your culture and by the beauty of this land, and most of all, by the Mexican people.  You’ve been so kind and gracious to me.  You’ve welcomed my wife, Michelle, here.  (Applause.)  You’ve welcomed our daughter, Malia, and her classmates to Oaxaca.  And as a proud father, I have to say that Malia’s Spanish is getting very good.  It helps that she’s smarter than I am.
 
And it’s an honor to be back in Mexico City -- one of the world’s great cities.  Es un placer estar entre amigos.  (Applause.) 

And it’s fitting that we gather at this great museum, which celebrates Mexico’s ancient civilizations and their achievements in arts and architecture, medicine and mathematics.  In modern times, Mexico’s blend of cultures and traditions found its expression in the murals of Rivera and the paintings of Frida, and the poetry of Sor Juana and the essays of Octavio Paz.  And Paz once spoke words that capture the spirit of our gathering here today -- in this place that celebrates your past, but which this morning is filled with so many young people who will shape Mexico’s future.  Octavio Paz said, “Modernity is not outside us, it is within us.  It is today and the most ancient antiquity; it is tomorrow and the beginning of the world; it is a thousand years old and yet newborn.”
 
And that’s why I wanted this opportunity to speak with all of you today, because you live at the intersection of history that Octavio Paz was referring to.  The young people of Mexico, you honor your heritage, thousands of years old, but you’re also part of something new, a nation that’s in the process of remaking itself.  And as our modern world changes around us, it’s the spirit of young people, your optimism and your idealism, and your willingness to discard old habits that are no longer working that will drive the world forward.
 
You see the difference between the world as it is and the world as it could to be; between old attitudes that stifle progress and the new thinking that allows us to connect and collaborate across cultures.  And by the way, that includes how we think about the relationship between Mexico and the United States.
 
Despite all the bonds and the values that we share, despite all the people who claim heritage on both sides, our attitudes sometimes are trapped in old stereotypes.  Some Americans only see the Mexico that is depicted in sensational headlines of violence and border crossings.  And let’s admit it, some Mexicans think that America disrespects Mexico, or thinks that America is trying to impose itself on Mexican sovereignty, or just wants to wall ourselves off.  And in both countries such distortions create misunderstandings that make it harder for us to move forward together.  So I've come to Mexico because I think it’s time for us to put the old mind-sets aside.  It’s time to recognize new realities -- including the impressive progress of today’s Mexico. (Applause.)

It is true that there are Mexicans all across this country who are making courageous sacrifices for the security of your country; that in the countryside and the neighborhoods not far from here, there are those who are still struggling to give their children a better life.  But what’s also clear is that a new Mexico is emerging.

I see it in the deepening of Mexico’s democracy, citizens who are standing up and saying that violence and impunity is not acceptable; a courageous press that’s working to hold leaders accountable; a robust civil society, including brave defenders of human rights who demand dignity and rule of law.  You have political parties that are competing vigorously, but also transferring power peacefully, and forging compromise.  And that's all a sign of the extraordinary progress that's taken place here in Mexico. 

And even though we know the work of perfecting democracy is never finished -- that's true in America, that's true here in Mexico -- you go forward knowing the truth that Benito Juarez once spoke -- “democracy is the destiny of humanity.”  And we are seeing that here in Mexico.  (Applause.)  We're seeing that here in Mexico.   
 
We're also seeing a Mexico that’s creating new prosperity:  Trading with the world.  Becoming a manufacturing powerhouse -- from Tijuana to Monterrey to Guadalajara and across the central highlands -- a global leader in automobiles and appliances and electronics, but also a center of high-tech innovation, producing the software and the hardware of our digital age.  One man in Querétaro spoke for an increasing number of Mexicans.  “There’s no reason to go abroad in search of a better life.  There are good opportunities here.”  That's what he said, and you are an example of that.
 
And, in fact, I see a Mexico that’s lifted millions of people from poverty.  Because of the sacrifices of generations, a majority of Mexicans now call themselves middle class, with a quality of life that your parents and grandparents could only dream of.  This includes, by the way, opportunities for women, who are proving that when you give women a chance, they will shape our destiny just as well as men, if not better.  (Applause.)
 
I also see in Mexico’s youth an empowered generation because of technology.  I think I see some of you tweeting right now -- (laughter) -- what’s happening.  (Laughter.)  And whether it’s harnessing social media to preserve indigenous languages, or speaking up for the future that you want, you’re making it clear that you want your voice heard.  
 
And because of all the dynamic progress that's taking place here in Mexico, Mexico is also taking its rightful place in the world, on the world stage.  Mexico is standing up for democracy not just here in Mexico but throughout the hemisphere.  Mexico is sharing expertise with neighbors across the Americas.  When they face earthquakes or threats to their citizens, or go to the polls to cast their votes, Mexico is there, helping its neighbors.  Mexico has joined the ranks of the world’s largest economies.  It became the first Latin American nation to host the G20.
 
Just as Mexico is being transformed, so are the ties between our two countries.  As President, I’ve been guided by a basic proposition -- in this relationship there’s no senior partner or junior partner; we are two equal partners, two sovereign nations. We must work together in mutual interest and mutual respect.  And if we do that both Mexico and the United States will prosper. (Applause.) 
  
And just as I worked with President Calderón, I’ve reaffirmed with President Peña Nieto that the great partnership between our two countries will not simply continue, it’s going to grow stronger and become broader.  In my time with President Peña Nieto, I’ve come to see his deep commitment to Mexico and its future.  And we share the belief that as leaders our guiding mission is to improve the lives of our people.  And so we agree that the relationship between our nations must be defined not by the threats that we face but by the prosperity and the opportunity that we can create together.  (Applause.) 

Now, as equal partners, both our nations must recognize our mutual responsibilities.  So here in Mexico, you’ve embarked on an ambitious reform agenda to make your economy more competitive and your institutions more accountable to you, the Mexican people.  As you pursue these reforms, I want you to know that you have strong support in the United States.  Because we believe, I believe, that people all around the world deserve the best from their government.  And whether you’re looking for basic services, or trying to start a new business, we share your belief that you should be able to make it through your day without paying a bribe.  And when talented Mexicans like you imagine your future, you should have every opportunity to succeed right here in the country you love.
 
And in the United States, we recognize our responsibilities.  We understand that much of the root cause of violence that's been happening here in Mexico, for which many so Mexicans have suffered, is the demand for illegal drugs in the United States.  And so we’ve got to continue to make progress on that front.  (Applause.)

I’ve been asked, and I honestly do not believe that legalizing drugs is the answer.  But I do believe that a comprehensive approach -- not just law enforcement, but education and prevention and treatment -- that's what we have to do.  And we’re going to stay at it because the lives of our children and the future of our nations depend on it.
 
And we also recognize that most of the guns used to commit violence here in Mexico come from the United States.  (Applause.) I think many of you know that in America, our Constitution guarantees our individual right to bear arms, and as President I swore an oath to uphold that right and I always will.  But at the same time, as I’ve said in the United States, I will continue to do everything in my power to pass common-sense reforms that keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous people.  That can save lives here in Mexico and back home in the United States. It’s the right thing to do.  (Applause.)  So we’ll keep increasing the pressure on gun traffickers who bring illegal guns into Mexico.  We’ll keep putting these criminals where they belong -- behind bars. 

We recognize we’ve got work to do on security issues, but we also recognize our responsibility -- as a nation that believes that all people are created equal -- we believe it’s our responsibility to make sure that we treat one another with dignity and respect.  And this includes recognizing how the United States has been strengthened by the extraordinary contributions of immigrants from Mexico and by Americans of Mexican heritage.  (Applause.)
 
Mexican Americans enrich our communities, including my hometown of Chicago, where you can walk through neighborhoods like Pilsen, Little Village -- La Villita -- dotted with murals of Mexican patriots.  You can stop at a fonda, you can hear some mariachis, where we are inspired by the deep faith of our peoples at churches like Our Lady of Guadalupe.  We’ve got a Chicagoan in here somewhere.  (Applause.)
 
And we’re so grateful to Mexican Americans in every segment of our society -- for teaching our children, and running our companies, and serving with honor in our military, and making breakthroughs in science, standing up for social justice.  As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. told Cesar Chavez once, we are “brothers in the fight for equality.”  And, in fact, without the strong support of Latinos, including so many Mexican Americans, I would not be standing today as President of the United States.  (Applause.)  That's the truth.
 
And so given that is Americas heritage, given that we share a border with Mexico, given ties that run back generations, it is critical that the United States recognize the need to reform our immigration system -- (applause) -- because we are a nation of laws, but we're also a nation of immigrants.  Like every nation we have a responsibility to ensure that our laws are upheld.  But we also know that, as a nation of immigrants, the immigration system we have in the United States right now doesn’t reflect our values.  It separates families when we should be reuniting them. It’s led to millions of people to live in the shadows.  It deprives us of the talents of so many young people -- even though we know that immigrants have always been the engine of our economy, starting some of our greatest companies and pioneering new industries.
 
That’s one of the reasons I acted to lift the shadow of deportation from what we call the DREAMers -- young people brought to the United States as children.  (Applause.)  And that’s why I’m working with our Congress to pass common-sense immigration reform this year.  (Applause.)  I'm convinced we can get it done.   Reform that continues to strengthen border security and strengthen legal immigration, so citizens don’t have to wait years to bring their families to the United States.  Reform that holds everyone accountable -- so immigrants get on the right side of the law and so immigrants are not exploited and abused.  And most of all, reform that gives millions of undocumented individuals a pathway to earn their citizenship.   And I’m optimistic that -- after years of trying -- we are going to get it done this year.  I'm absolutely convinced of it.  (Applause.) 
 
Obviously, we’re going to have to work with the Mexican government to make sure that we've got a well-regulated border.  But I also want to work with the Mexican government because I believe that the long-term solution to the challenge of illegal immigration is a growing and prosperous Mexico that creates more jobs and opportunities for young people here.
 
I agree with the Mexican student who said, “I feel like we can reach the same level as anyone in the world.”  That's absolutely true.  And so I firmly believe -- juntos, podemos lograr más -- together, we can achieve more.  (Applause.)  So with the remainder of my time today, I want to focus on five areas where we can do more.
 
Number one, let’s do more to expand trade and commerce that creates good jobs for our people.  We already buy more of your exports than any country in the world.  We sell more of our exports to Mexico than we do to Brazil, Russia, India and China combined.  (Applause.)  Mexican companies are investing more in the United States, and we’re the largest foreign investor in Mexico -- because we believe in Mexico and want to be a partner in your success.
 
So guided by the new economic dialogue that President Peña Nieto and I announced yesterday, let’s do more to unlock the true potential of our relationship.  Let’s keep investing in our roads and our bridges and our border crossings so we can trade faster and cheaper.  Let’s help our smaller businesses, which employ most of our workers, access new markets and new capital -- the big markets right across the border.  Let’s empower our young entrepreneurs as they create startup companies that can transform how we live.  (Applause.)  And let’s realize the Trans-Pacific Partnership this year, so our two nations can compete and win in the fast-growing markets of the Asia Pacific.  If the United States and Mexico are working together, we can sell a whole lot of things on the other side of the Pacific Ocean where the fastest-growing economies are taking off right now.  That's number one.
 
Number two, let’s not just sell more things to each other, let’s build more things together.  With many of our companies operating in both countries, parts are now being shipped back and forth across the border as they’re assembled.  So every day, U.S. and Mexican workers are building things together -- whether it’s crafts -- or whether it’s cars, or aircraft, or computers, or satellites.
 
I think this is only the beginning.  Given the skills of our workers, it makes even more sense for companies around the world to set up shop in the United States and set up shop in Mexico.  And as Mexico reforms, we’re going to be able to do more business together and sell more goods around the world.  And the more that our companies collaborate, the more competitive they’ll be.  And the entire hemisphere will benefit because of those links and chains that have been created between our two countries.  
 
Number three, as we secure our economic future, let’s secure our energy future, including the clean energy that we need to combat climate change.  Our nations are blessed with boundless natural beauty -- from our coastlines and farmlands to your tropical forests.  But climate change is happening.  The science is undeniable.  And so is the fact that our economies must become greener.
 
In the United States, we’ve made historic commitments to clean and renewable energy like solar and wind power.  We've made a commitment to reduce the emissions of harmful carbon pollution.  And here in Mexico, you’re a leader in cutting carbon emissions and helping developing countries do the same.  So, together, let’s keep building new energy partnerships by harnessing all these new sources, and, by the way, creating the good jobs that come with these new technologies.  And let’s keep investing in green buildings and technologies that make our entire economy more efficient, but also make our planet cleaner and safer for future generations.  (Applause.)
 
Number four -- and this is part of staying competitive -- let’s do more together in education so our young people have the knowledge and skills to succeed.  (Applause.)  Here in Mexico you’ve made important progress, with more children staying in school longer, and record numbers of students like you getting a university education.  Just imagine how much the students of our two countries could do together, how much we could learn from each other. 

And that’s why President Peña Nieto and I announced a new partnership in higher education -- to encourage more collaboration between our universities and our university students.  (Applause.)  We’re going to focus on science and  technology, on engineering and mathematics.  And this is part of my broader initiative called 100,000 Strong in the Americas.  We want 100,000 students from the United States studying in Latin America, including Mexico.  And we want 100,000 Latin American students, including Mexican students, to come to study in the United States of America.  (Applause.)  Because when we study together, and we learn together, we work together, and we prosper together -- that's what I believe.  (Applause.)
 
And finally, to help spark prosperity in both out countries, let’s truly invest in innovation, and research and development together.  Here in Mexico, you’re now a global leader in graduating engineers and technicians.  One of Mexico’s leading scientists, Rafael Navarro-González, is helping analyze data from the rover that we landed on Mars.
 
So, together, let’s remember that every dollar, every peso that we invest in research and development returns so much more to our economies in jobs and opportunity, new products, new services.  That's why I'm calling for us to forge new partnerships in aerospace, and IT, and nanotechnology and biotechnology and robotics.  Let’s answer the hope of a young woman -- a student at the National Polytechnic Institute -- who spoke for many in your generation, so eager to make your mark.  She said, “Give us jobs as creators.”  Give us jobs as creators.

Sometimes young people are known as just consumers of goods, but we want young people creating the new products, the next big thing that will change how we live our lives.  That's the agenda that I want to pursue.  
 
And I understand that there are those both here in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, but also back home in the United States, who are skeptical of your progress, who maybe doubt the  capacity for us to make the most of this moment.  There are always cynics who say, aw, this is too hard, the headwinds you face are too stiff.  They say Mexico has been here before we look like we're making progress, we're looking at a bright horizon, on the verge of great possibility, but then we get blown off course.
And it’s true that nothing is inevitable.  Progress and success is never guaranteed.  The future that you dream of, the Mexico you imagine -- it must be built, it must be earned.  Nobody else can do it for you.  Only you can earn it.  You are the future.  As Nervo wrote in “La Raza de Bronce,” tu eres el sueño -- you are the dream.  (Applause.)
 
For just as it was patriots who answered the call when Father Hidalgo rang the church bell two centuries ago, you -- your lives, in a free Mexico -- are the dream that they imagined.  And now it falls to you to keep alive those virtues for which so many generations of Mexicans struggled.
 
You are the dream that can stand up for justice and human rights and human dignity, here at home and around the world.  You’re the creators and the builders and the climbers and the strivers who can deliver progress and prosperity that will lift up not just the Mexican people for generations to come, but the entire world.
 
You’re the men and women who will push this nation upwards as Mexico assumes its rightful place, as you proudly sing: “in heaven your eternal destiny was written by the finger of God.”
 
You are the dream.  This is your moment.  And as you reach for the future, always remember that you have the greatest of  partners, the greatest if friends -- the nation that is rooting for your success more than anybody else -- your neighbor, the United States of America.  (Applause.)
 
Viva México!   Viva los Estados Unidos!   Que Dios los bendiga!  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

Ukrainian president delivers historic address to MPs in the Commons via video link as country resists Russian invasion

Ukraine-Russia war – latest updates

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has delivered a historic address to the House of Commons that was beamed into the chamber via a live feed as his country continues to resist invasion by Russia.

According to the English language translation on Parliament TV, here is what Zelenskiy told MPs and peers.

“Mr Speaker, all the members of parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I am addressing all the people of the United Kingdom and all the people from the country with a big history.

“I am addressing you as a citizen, as a president, of also a big country, with a dream and big effort.

“I would like to tell you about the 13 days of war, the war that we didn’t start and we didn’t want. However we have to conduct this war, we do not want to lose what we have, what is ours, our country Ukraine.

“Just the same way you once didn’t want to lose your country when the Nazis started to fight your country and you had to fight for Britain.

“Thirteen days of this struggle. On day one, at four o’clock in the morning we were attacked by cruise missiles. Everybody woke up, people with children, the entire Ukraine, and since then we have not been sleeping.

“We have all been fighting for our country, with our army.

“On day two, we have been fighting airstrikes and our heroic military servicemen on the islands have been trying to fight. When Russian forces demanded that we lay down arms … we did continue fighting, and we did feel the force of our people that opposed the occupants until the end.

“The next day, the artillery started fighting us. Our army showed us who we are.”

“On day four, we started taking people captive. We have not been torturing them – we remain humane even on day four of this terrible war.

“On day five, the terror against us took place against children, against cities, and constant shelling has been taking place around the country, including hospitals, and that didn’t break us, and that gave us feeling of big truth.

“On day six, the Russian rockets fell on Babi Yar – that is the place where the Nazis killed thousands of people during the second world war – and 80 years after the Russians hit at them for the second time, and even churches are getting destroyed by shelling.

“On day eight, we saw Russian tanks hitting the atomic power station and everybody then understood that this is the terror against everyone.

“On day nine, there was a meeting of Nato congress without the result we were looking for. Yes, we did feel that, unfortunately, the alliances don’t always work properly, and the no-fly zone cannot be enforced.

“On day 10, the Ukrainians started protesting and stopping the armoured vehicles with their own hands.

“On day 11, the children and cities were being hit and hospitals as well with the rockets and constant shelling, and on that day we realised that Ukrainians became heroes, entire cities, children, adults.

“On day 12, the losses of the Russian army exceeded 10,000 people killed, and also including the general, and that gave us hope that there will be some kind of responsibility for those people in front of the court.

“On day 13, in the city of Mariupol that was attacked by the Russian force, a child was killed. They do not allow any food, any water and people started panicking.

“I think everybody can hear that people do not have water over 13 days of this situation, over 50 children have been killed. These are the children that could have lived but these people have taken them away from us.

“Ukraine were not looking to have this war. The Ukraine have not been looking to become big but they have become big over the days of this war. We are the country that are saving people despite having to fight one of the biggest armies in the world. We have to fight the helicopters, rockets.

“The question for us now is to be or not to be. Oh no, this Shakespearean question. For 13 days this question could have been asked but now I can give you a definitive answer. It’s definitely yes, to be.

“And I would like to remind you the words that the United Kingdom have already heard, which are important again. We will not give up and we will not lose.

“We will fight until the end, at sea, in the air. We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost.

“We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets.

“I’d like to add that we will fight on the banks of different rivers and we’re looking for your help, for the help of the civilised countries.

“We’re thankful for this help and I’m very grateful to you Boris, please increase the pressure of sanctions against this country (Russia), please recognise this country as a terrorist state and please make sure our Ukrainian skies are safe.

“Please make sure you do what needs to be done and what is stipulated by the greatness of your country.

“Glory to Ukraine and glory to the United Kingdom.”

The Evolution of Broadcasting: From the Airwaves to the Digital Age
The Evolution of Broadcasting: From the Airwaves to the Digital Age

Broadcasting, the transmission of audio or video content to a wide audience, has undergone a remarkable journey since its inception. From the early days of radio waves to the digital revolution of today, broadcasting has shaped culture, politics, and society. In this blog post, we'll delve into the fascinating history of broadcasting, exploring its origins, milestones, and the transformative impact it continues to have on our world.

The Birth of Broadcasting: The story of broadcasting begins in the late 19th century with the pioneering work of inventors like Guglielmo Marconi and Nikola Tesla. Marconi's experiments with wireless telegraphy laid the groundwork for what would become radio broadcasting. In 1895, he successfully transmitted radio signals across a distance of over a mile, demonstrating the potential for long-distance communication without wires.

By the early 20th century, radio broadcasting had emerged as a powerful medium for entertainment, news, and communication. The first scheduled radio broadcast took place in 1920 when station KDKA in Pittsburgh aired the results of the U.S. presidential election. This historic event marked the beginning of a new era in mass communication.

The Golden Age of Radio
The 1920s and 1930s are often referred to as the ""Golden Age of Radio."" During this time, radio broadcasting flourished, captivating audiences with a diverse array of programming. From comedy shows and variety programs to news broadcasts and serialized dramas, radio offered something for everyone.

One of the most iconic radio programs of the era was Orson Welles' ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast in 1938. Presented as a series of realistic news bulletins, the program famously caused widespread panic among listeners who believed that Martians were invading Earth. This incident highlighted the power of radio to evoke emotions and shape public perception.

Radio also played a crucial role during World War II, serving as a vital source of news and morale-boosting entertainment for troops and civilians alike. Broadcasters like Edward R. Murrow became household names for their fearless reporting from the front lines.

The Rise of Television
While radio dominated the airwaves for much of the early 20th century, the advent of television would soon revolutionize the broadcasting industry. The first experimental television broadcasts began in the 1920s, but it wasn't until the post-war period that television became a mainstream medium.

In 1948, the first regularly scheduled television programming began in the United States with the launch of networks like NBC and CBS. The popularity of television soared as families across the country gathered around their sets to watch sitcoms, dramas, and live events like the World Series and the moon landing.

Television also brought visual storytelling to a whole new level, with iconic shows like ""I Love Lucy,"" ""The Twilight Zone,"" and ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" captivating audiences with their compelling characters and groundbreaking visuals. Advertisers quickly recognized the potential of television as a marketing platform, leading to the rise of the commercial broadcast model.

The Digital Revolution
The latter half of the 20th century saw further advancements in broadcasting technology, including the transition from analog to digital transmission. Digital broadcasting offered improved audio and video quality, as well as greater efficiency in spectrum usage.

The rise of cable and satellite television in the 1980s and 1990s expanded the number of channels available to viewers, providing access to niche content and specialized programming. This era also saw the emergence of 24-hour news channels like CNN, which transformed the way news was delivered and consumed.

The Internet Age
The dawn of the internet age brought yet another paradigm shift to the broadcasting industry. The rise of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube challenged traditional broadcasters by offering on-demand access to a vast library of content.

Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram further disrupted the industry, enabling broadcasters to interact with their audience in real-time and extend the reach of their content beyond traditional channels. Live streaming has become increasingly popular, allowing individuals and organizations to broadcast events, concerts, and breaking news directly to viewers around the world.

The Future of Broadcasting: As we look to the future, it's clear that broadcasting will continue to evolve and adapt to new technologies and consumer preferences. Virtual reality, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence are poised to revolutionize the way we experience content, blurring the lines between the physical and digital worlds.

However, one thing remains constant: the power of broadcasting to inform, entertain, and inspire audiences on a global scale. Whether it's through the airwaves, cable, satellite, or the internet, broadcasting will continue to shape our culture and connect us in ways we never thought possible.

The history of broadcasting is a testament to human ingenuity and innovation. From humble beginnings to the digital age, broadcasting has undergone a remarkable evolution, shaping the way we communicate, entertain, and understand the world around us. As we embrace new technologies and platforms, let us never forget the enduring power of broadcasting to unite us as a global community.";Explore the history of broadcasting and mass communication;"Origins of Broadcasting:  The history begins in the late **19th century** with inventors like **Guglielmo Marconi** and **Nikola Tesla**.

In his broadcast, he often set the news straight on the current events, dismissing rumors and explaining his course of action plainly. FDR had a high presidential approval rating largely due to these chats.

This effective communication via radio, culminating in 30 total addresses of around 20 minute length, was a successful experiment done by the FDR administration offering to give an unfiltered lens on current affairs, without any distortion by media. In nature, the chats felt personal and informal, targeted towards a very general audience. The chats led to a turnaround in the confidence of people in the time when the news was perpetuating doom for banks. Because of the effectiveness of such chats, FDR is still often regarded as one of the best radio communicators in history.

The term “fireside chat” finds its inspiration in FDR’s interpretation of the chats, imaging as if he was speaking to a small audience seated around a fireplace. In this way, viewers were able to see Roosevelt’s room alongside his fireplace, as if they were sitting beside him.";34324;"The example to research on: Fireside chats

The choice to do the broadcast was very last-minute, having happened merely months before launch and with considerably pushback by NASA, contesting that there wasn’t much of a purpose and that voice communication should be prioritized. Nonetheless, the idea went through with a Westinghouse camera broadcasting to a large satellite dish in New South Wales (the Parkes radio telescope). Various mechanical issues had to be ironed out, including a fire in the transmitter, but the result was a challenging, yet flawless tracking of the signal.

In the moments before the first step on the moon, the camera mounted on the side of the capsule began signalling to the dish in NSW. And then it happened.

While the live broadcast was an idea proposed by ABC, the time-slot change was too drastic, and the game went down 3 hours before its optimal screening time.

New neuroscience is challenging our understanding of the dying process—bringing opportunities for the living.

a series of open doors leading to a bright light with the wallpaper showing a twilight view over the ocean

November 17, 2023
The Biggest Questions is a mini-series that explores how technology is helping probe some of the deepest, most mind-bending questions of our existence.
Just as birth certificates note the time we enter the world, death certificates mark the moment we exit it. This practice reflects traditional notions about life and death as binaries. We are here until, suddenly, like a light switched off, we are gone. 

But while this idea of death is pervasive, evidence is building that it is an outdated social construct, not really grounded in biology. Dying is in fact a process—one with no clear point demarcating the threshold across which someone cannot come back.

Scientists and many doctors have already embraced this more nuanced understanding of death. As society catches up, the implications for the living could be profound. “There is potential for many people to be revived again,” says Sam Parnia, director of critical care and resuscitation research at NYU Langone Health. 

Neuroscientists, for example, are learning that the brain can survive surprising levels of oxygen deprivation. This means the window of time that doctors have to reverse the death process could someday be extended. Other organs likewise seem to be recoverable for much longer than is reflected in current medical practice, opening up possibilities for expanding the availability of organ donations.

The Biggest Questions
To do so, though, we need to reconsider how we conceive of and approach life and death. Rather than thinking of death as an event from which one cannot recover, Parnia says, we should instead view it as a transient process of oxygen deprivation that has the potential to become irreversible if enough time passes or medical interventions fail. If we adopt this mindset about death, Parnia says, “then suddenly, everyone will say, ‘Let’s treat it.’”   

Moving goalposts 
Legal and biological definitions of death typically refer to the “irreversible cessation” of life-sustaining processes supported by the heart, lungs, and brain. The heart is the most common point of failure, and for the vast majority of human history, when it stopped there was generally no coming back. 

That changed around 1960, with the invention of CPR. Until then, resuming a stalled heartbeat had largely been considered the stuff of miracles; now, it was within the grasp of modern medicine. CPR forced the first major rethink of death as a concept. “Cardiac arrest” entered the lexicon, creating a clear semantic separation between the temporary loss of heart function and the permanent cessation of life. 

Around the same time, the advent of positive-pressure mechanical ventilators, which work by delivering breaths of air to the lungs, began allowing people who incurred catastrophic brain injury—for example, from a shot to the head, a massive stroke, or a car accident—to continue breathing. In autopsies after these patients died, however, researchers discovered that in some cases their brains had been so severely damaged that the tissue had begun to liquefy. In such cases, ventilators had essentially created “a beating-heart cadaver,” says Christof Koch, a neuroscientist at the Allen Institute in Seattle.


These observations led to the concept of brain death and ushered in medical, ethical, and legal debate about the ability to declare such patients dead before their heart stops beating. Many countries did eventually adopt some form of this new definition. Whether we talk about brain death or biological death, though, the scientific intricacies behind these processes are far from established. “The more we characterize the dying brain, the more we have questions,” says Charlotte Martial, a neuroscientist at the University of Liège in Belgium. “It’s a very, very complex phenomenon.” 

Brains on the brink
Traditionally, doctors have thought that the brain begins incurring damage minutes after it’s deprived of oxygen. While that’s the conventional wisdom, says Jimo Borjigin, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, “you have to wonder, why would our brain be built in such a fragile manner?”

Researchers repaired cells in damaged pig organs an hour after the animal’s death
The system, previously used to return circulation to severed pigs’ brains, can now restore some functions of cells in other vital organs

Recent research suggests that perhaps it actually isn’t. In 2019, scientists reported in Nature that they were able to restore a suite of functions in the brains of 32 pigs that had been decapitated in a slaughterhouse four hours earlier. The researchers restarted circulation and cellular activity in the brains using an oxygen-rich artificial blood infused with a cocktail of protective pharmaceuticals. They also included drugs that stopped neurons from firing, preventing any chance that the pig brains would regain consciousness. They kept the brains alive for up to 36 hours before ending the experiment. “Our work shows there’s probably a lot more damage from lack of oxygen that’s reversible than people thought before,” says coauthor Stephen Latham, a bioethicist at Yale University. 

In 2022, Latham and colleagues published a second paper in Nature announcing that they’d been able to recover many functions in multiple organs, including the brain and heart, in whole-body pigs that had been killed an hour earlier. They continued the experiment for six hours and confirmed that the anesthetized, previously dead animals had regained circulation and that numerous key cellular functions were active. 

“What these studies have shown is that the line between life and death isn’t as clear as we once thought,” says Nenad Sestan, a neuroscientist at the Yale School of Medicine and senior author of both pig studies. Death “takes longer than we thought, and at least some of the processes can be stopped and reversed.” 

A handful of studies in humans have also suggested that the brain is better than we thought at handling a lack of oxygen after the heart stops beating. “When the brain is deprived of life-sustaining oxygen, in some cases there seems to be this paradoxical electrical surge,” Koch says. “For reasons we don’t understand, it’s hyperactive for at least a few minutes.” 

In a study published in September in Resuscitation, Parnia and his colleagues collected brain oxygen and electrical activity data from 85 patients who experienced cardiac arrest while they were in the hospital. Most of the patients’ brain activity initially flatlined on EEG monitors, but for around 40% of them, near-normal electrical activity intermittently reemerged in their brains up to 60 minutes into CPR. 

Similarly, in a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in May, Borjigin and her colleagues reported surges of activity in the brains of two comatose patients after their ventilators had been removed. The EEG signatures occurred just before the patients died and had all the hallmarks of consciousness, Bojigin says. While many questions remain, such findings raise tantalizing questions about the death process and the mechanisms of consciousness.";What is death;"- **Definition of Death:** ⚰️ Traditionally viewed as a **binary** event—life stops suddenly.

The more scientists can learn about the mechanisms behind the dying process, the greater the chances of developing “more systematic rescue efforts,” Borjigin says. In best-case scenarios, she adds, this line of study could have “the potential to rewrite medical practices and save a lot of people.” 

Everyone, of course, does eventually have to die and will someday be beyond saving. But a more exact understanding of the dying process could enable doctors to save some previously healthy people who meet an unexpected early end and whose bodies are still relatively intact. Examples could include people who suffer heart attacks, succumb to a deadly loss of blood, or choke or drown. The fact that many of these people die and stay dead simply reflects “a lack of proper resource allocation, medical knowledge, or sufficient advancement to bring them back,” Parnia says.   


Borjigin’s hope is to eventually understand the dying process “second by second.” Such discoveries could not only contribute to medical advancements, she says, but also “revise and revolutionize our understanding of brain function.”

Sestan says he and his colleagues are likewise working on follow-up studies that seek to “perfect the technology” they have used to restore metabolic function in pig brains and other organs. This line of research could eventually lead to technologies that are able to reverse damage—up to a point, of course—from oxygen deprivation in the brain and other organs in people whose hearts have stopped. If successful, the method could also expand the pool of available organ donors, Sestan adds, by lengthening the window of time doctors have to recover organs from the permanently deceased. 

If these breakthroughs do come, Sestan emphasizes, they will take years of research. “It’s important that we not overexaggerate and promise too much,” he says, “although that doesn’t mean we don’t have a vision.” 

In the meantime, ongoing investigations into the dying process will no doubt continue to challenge our notions of death, leading to sea changes within science and other realms of society, from the theological to the legal.

423itdhs;;51e7e065;81c76521;cc25b4d2;;"The three-body problem is a problem in classical physics where it is really challenging to accurately predict the movement of three objects (with mass) in space. The problem first came up when calculating the relative positions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, and is a part of the problem that there exists no general closed-form calculation for a system with more than 2 objects (the n-body problem).

In simple, while it’s easy to calculate the movement of two objects which attract each other with gravity, it becomes much more difficult when introducing a third object. Because there isn’t a formula, scientists use predictions using numerical methods and analysis.

There exist scenarios where three body systems can be calculated, and those are within the category of orderly solutions. They’re called periodic solutions, and have very simple analysis tied to them. However, the vast majority of three body systems remain unsolved, as the force of gravity between the objects is largely chaotic.

Because of the chaotic nature of the three body problem, an issue which occurs is that no single simulation is completely accurate. This problem exists because small changes can produce wildly different results, so multiple simulations of an identically inputted three body system could result in completely different configurations.

Interestingly, the problem doesn’t arise if we replace Fg with Fs. That is, in elastic motion, the three-body problem is solved.

An important concept here is a Lagrange point (2022 reference!), basically points of equilibrium for objects in the gravitational field of two much larger objects. Calculating Lagrange points involves the 3-body problem, as there are 3 masses at work; however, there is a formula for Lagrange points, considering it works on a solved variation of the 3-body problem. This relies on the fact that the object in the point is much smaller in magnitude.

There are 5 total lagrange points. Three are along the orbit of one larger mass around the other in a symmetrical configuration, and two are on opposite sides of the smaller mass.";;;Three-body problem: predicting movement of three space objects.;"- **Three-Body Problem**: A classical physics challenge in predicting the movement of three gravitationally interacting objects.

Casey BaseelCasey BaseelOct 29, 2022




We sit down for an interview with an industry pro and learn about “zamaa-style” manga too.


Isekai, or alternate world stories, have become one of the most popular anime/manga genres, so much so that there are now a number of recognizable isekai subgenres.

For example, there’s the tensei (“reincarnation”) genre, where someone from our world doesn’t just get whisked off to another one, but dies and is reborn there as a different person, but with their real-world memories intact. There’s also the akuyaku reijo (“high-class young villainess”) category, itself a subgenre of tensei, where the main character is reborn as a powerful figure in the alternate world who’d usually be an isekai story’s antagonist.

On a whim, our Japanese-language reporter Mariko Ohanabatake decided to put “tensei” into the search function of Manga Okoku, a popular digital manga publishing site in Japan. She got back…



1,771 results, and doing the same for “akuyaku reijo” got her another 365!

But why are reincarnation and villainess stories so popular? To find out, Mariko sat down with veteran manga editor Y-san (not her real name). Y-san has been working as a manga editor at a major publisher for more than 10 years, editing series that have gone on to win awards and have anime adaptations, and here’s what she had to tell us.

Mariko: Is there a specific title that kicked off the current tensei boom?

Y-san: I think That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime becoming a hit was a major turning point. The series started as a web novel on the site Shosetsuka ni Narou (“Let’s Become Novelists”), and once it got popular there, it got turned into a manga. There are a lot of reincarnation stories on the site, so many that some people also call tensei stories “Narou stories.”

In the industry, we used to have a lot of time travel stories, or teni (“transfer”) stories, where someone would go to a different time or place while still retaining their original appearance and identity. But the tensei stories that are in vogue now are different in that the main character dies in our world, then they awaken in a different world as a different person, but with their real-world memories intact.

Mariko: In tensei stories, when they get to the alternate world they look different and have a completely new lifestyle, don’t they?.

Y-san: I think the reason for that is to appeal to readers who want to become a different person than they are now and redo their life. It’s a frequent characteristic of tensei stories that the main character’s real-world background and what kind of person they were before coming to the alternate world aren’t treated as being very important.

▼ Y-san



Mariko: Yeah, I’ve noticed that they don’t really go into much depth about those kinds of things.

Y-san: Usually there are just a few quick pages at the start of the first chapter about the main character’s life in our world, then they die and we get to the start of the story in the alternate world. There’s not much weight given to the kind of person they were or what kind of upbringing and experiences they had in our world. I think they just want to establish, as quickly as they can, ‘Ok, here’s this person…now he’s dead…and now he’s starting a new life.’ I’m sometimes surprised at how little need the story seems to have for readers to sympathize with the main character while they’re still in the real world.

Mariko: What about villainess reincarnation stories? I notice a lot of comics aimed at women recently where the main character was a timid person in the real world, and I can understand the desire to be reborn as a more powerful person, but why a villainess?

Y-san: Well, for a long time, the standard pattern in shojo manga has been that the main character is eventually rewarded for being purehearted and earnest. But with the advancement of social media, I think that messier, more realistic emotions and romance have become more visible, and that some people are tired of such purehearted main characters.

Mariko: I think there aren’t many people who can live their lives like a pure, earnest shojo heroine.

Y-san: But in contrast, a powerful villainess can be forcefully bold and tell off people she doesn’t like. I think that’s something people find appealing. Stories where the villainess breaks off an engagement are popular too. It might be a result of empathizing with that desire to be free of a man’s control.

Mariko: Oh, I get it now! A rich, powerful villainess can do what she wants, and doesn’t have to mince words talking with male characters. She’s basically unstoppable.

Y-san: By the way, there’s also a new genre, often aimed at male readers, with some similarities to tensei that’s called zamaa-style.

Mariko: Zamaa-style? What’s that?

Y-san: It’s from ‘zamaa miro’ [Japanese for “serves you right”]. The main character isn’t reincarnated, but instead is someone who was kicked out of a band of heroes who didn’t think he was good enough. Then the main character joins another party and finds success, while things fall apart for the party of heroes he used to be in. It’s similar to a revenge story.

Mariko: Have you ever served as the editor for a tensei manga series?

Y-san: Not a tensei one specifically, but I’ve been involved in the planning for an isekai series. But there’s something about them that…well, if I come right out and say it, I wondered if making an isekai series was a good decision for that manga artist’s future. Even if people read the series, there’s no point for the artist if that success can’t connect to their next series. Tensei series have so many similarities to each other, so it’s hard for an individual artist to develop a fanbase for themselves through one. The readers don’t generally react with, “Now I’ll check out their other works too.”

Mariko: I guess it’s true that if you can’t tell one series apart from another in the genre, you probably won’t remember the artist’s name either.

Y-san: But on the other hand, because it’s a popular genre, it’s easier for new artists to get their pitches greenlit, and there’s a big benefit to the artist on the financial end from higher sales by nature of their series being in a popular genre. The ideal is to get readers to become fans of both the series and the artist at the same time.

Mariko: Before we wrap things up, do you have any personal tensei recommendations for us manga readers?

Y-san: Of course! My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! (art by Nami Hidaka, story by Satoru Yamaguchi) has an interesting story and an appealing cast of characters. And it’s technically a teni story, but The Screwed-up Potions Turned Out to Be Soy Sauce, So I Cooked with Them [Hazure Poshon ga Shoyu Datta no de Ryori Suru Koto ni Shimashita] (art by Risuno, story by Fuji Tomato, and character concepts by Yuichi Murakami) is another I’m really enjoying reading. It’s got a really unique concept: a housewife gets transferred to another world and realizes that its defective healing potions are actually soy sauce, so she uses them for cooking.

Mixing fantasy alchemy and Japanese cuisine? It’s something we wouldn’t have thought up on our own, and a sign that even with as many lookalike isekai series as there are, there are still some original, interesting ideas within the genre if you know where to look.";Tensei Stories;"- **Popularity of Isekai:**  The **isekai** genre features characters transported to alternate worlds, gaining immense popularity in anime and manga.

Summary
Isekai anime offers escapist fantasy and wish fulfillment, often featuring relatable underdog protagonists.
Many isekai stories draw from video game tropes and concepts, appealing to gamers and non-gamers alike.
Isekai protagonists are often idealized, with attractive appearances and extraordinary abilities, providing a power fantasy for viewers.
There's no genre in anime that's more popular - or more despised - than that of isekai. Also known as ""reincarnation anime,"" this narrative archetype has overtaken the medium, along with related mediums manga and light novels. Due to how ubiquitous and many times uncreative the tropes involved are, some anime fans have come to dislike isekai. Be that as it is, however, these shows do have merit at an existential level.

Isekai is popular due to the escapist nature of the genre, especially since so many of the main characters are underdogs. Able to live a new life and not be relegated to the sidelines of life, the genre is the epitome of wish fulfillment. Add in the fact that so much of the genre has become tied to video games and similar activities, and it's no wonder why audiences don't mind repetition and regurgitation when it comes to reincarnation.";What is Isekai Anime;"- **Definition of Isekai**:  Isekai means ""another world"" in Japanese, often involving characters being transported to fantasy realms.

By Kevin Dolak August 27, 2012


Twentieth Century Fox/AP Photo

Although James Cameron's ""Avatar"" took place more than 140 years into the future, a Russian billionaire has teamed with dozens of scientists to lay out a plan that would use avatars to transfer human consciousness into an artificial form. The goal: human immortality by 2045.

The 2045 Initiative, a life-extension project founded by 31-year-old Russian billionaire Dmitry Itskov in February 2011, offers a timeline for immortality over the next 33 years. Beginning with remotely controlled robotic avatars and re-creating the human brain through computer models, the end result would be human immortality in the form of holographic avatars.

The 2045 Initiative, which has had a major social media blitz, brought together 30 top Russian scientists to develop the ""imortal"" technology, laying out the plan for human immortality on its website.

""The first phase is to create a humanoid robot dubbed 'avatar,' and a state-of-the-art brain-computer interface system. The next phase consists of creating a life-support system for the human brain and connect it to the 'avatar.' The final phase … is to create an artificial brain in which to transfer the original individual consciousness into,"" reads the plan.

Got that?

Here's the 2045 Initiative's timeline for this feat:

2015 - 2020: A robotic copy of a human body remotely controlled by a brain-computer interface

2020 - 2025: An avatar is created in which a human brain can be transplanted at the end of life

2030 - 2035: An avatar that can now contain an artificial brain in which a human personality can be transferred at the end of life

2040 - 2045: A holographic avatar emerges

In addition to taking the Internet by storm, the 2045 Initiative has also launched its own political party, called Evolution 2045, pushing a new strategy for human development. The Russia-based party takes a global approach, encouraging other countries to follow in its footsteps ""not in the arms race, but in the race for building a bright future for mankind.""

Last month Itskov appealed to members of the Forbes World's Billionaires List, urging them to take heed of the ""vital importance of funding scientific development in the field of cybernetic immortality and the artificial body.

""Contributing to cutting-edge innovations in the fields of neuroscience, nanotechnology and android robotics is more than building a brighter future for human civilization. [It's also] a wise and profitable business strategy that will create a new and vibrant industry of immortality - limitless in its importance and scale. This kind of investment will change every aspect of business as we know it,"" read Itskov's open letter.

Itskov plans to host a Global Future Congress meeting next year in New York. A previous event was held last February in Moscow.

This massive hypothetical technology would give the ""new"" mankind amazing survival abilities, according to the Initiative.

""The new human being will receive a huge range of abilities and will be capable of withstanding extreme external conditions easily: high temperatures, pressure, radiation, lack of oxygen,"" claims the Initiative on its website.

And according to a slick video produced by the 2045 Initiative, once the hologram-like avatar reinvents mankind's scientific and social structure, war and violence will go by the wayside as ""spiritual self-improvement"" becomes mankind's primary goal.

But what about the average Joe who just wants to live forever?

The cost of these avatars should be on par with that of an automobile, the Initiative's website assures, as soon as mass production begins.

So start saving up.";Initiative to live forever by billionaires;"**Dmitry Itskov's 2045 Initiative:**  A plan for **human immortality** using avatars, proposed by Russian billionaire **Dmitry Itskov** in 2011.

My Dress-Up Darling the Only Non-Fantasy Title in New Top 10 Ranking for 2024
My Dress Up Darling becomes the only non-fantasy or non-isekai manga to break into the top 10 of Kodakawa's top-ranked e-book list for 2024 thus far.

At the beginning of many isekai anime, manga and light novels, the main character reincarnates into their new world and life after having a disappointing run of things in their old ones. Whether they were a relative hikikomori that barely experienced life or a generic salaryman who had become bored with life, their previous existence offered few thrills or areas of excitement. In some cases, the employees are already middle-aged office workers whose prospects seem bleak in terms of truly making something of themselves.

Of course, upon reincarnating, they find that the sky is the limit in their brand-new world. These are usually fantasy-based locales similar to the novels and video games that the protagonist was familiar with in their other life. With knowledge of their previous world and a degree of a concept of their new one, these isekai heroes are able to march forward and have something completely fresh. In the case of the dark fantasy series Overlord, Ainz Ooal Gown quickly acclimates to being in a video game and is able to get used to his new life.

In the series Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon, ""Boxxo"" is a former vending machine enthusiast who's reborn as the object of his desire. While the result is a much different life than what he was used to, the result is that he gets to experience things that he never dreamed possible.

10 Most Questionable Storylines In Sword Art Online
Many of Sword Art Online's writing decisions have been called into question, with some choices being more egregious than others.

Many of the core elements and tropes in the isekai genre are based on classic fantasy video games, namely Japanese role-playing games such as Dragon Quest. These extend to modern online role-playing games, and the adaptation of these concepts is a huge part of why isekai is so popular. For actual fans of video games, it's a way to essentially watch a video game adaptation without doing so.

Whether they be anime, live-action TV shows or movies, adaptations of certain video games (including narrative-based role-playing games) can sometimes leave a lot to be desired. With shows such as Sword Art Online or Overlord, audiences are treated to concepts that are similar to the ones seen in those games, all without the expectation of actually pulling from established franchises and lore. The sense of familiarity makes it enjoyable for those who know what it's like to grind away for hours in order to level up, but there's more to it than just gaining EXP and getting stronger.

Isekai anime can also showcase the comradery seen in online role-playing video games, with clans, parties, teams and guilds, all resulting in bonds that can be as close as those in the ""real world."" In these shows, such friendships are forged because the struggles that the characters go through aren't merely digital pastimes, with said hardships making them stronger as individuals and a unit.

Thus, the defeats of major bosses and rival groups come off as huge accomplishments, and they can feel the same way if they only involve a few strokes or clicks. Not only is this all relatable to those who enjoy video games, but it's also a glimpse into the hobby for those who've never really engaged in it. Thus, reincarnation anime can be a look at two different worlds at once, depending on who's watching.

While it might seem like a superficial element, the fact of the matter is that, outside of ""monstrous"" reincarnations such as in So I'm a Spider, So What?, Overlord and a few other titles, most isekai protagonists are far from ugly. This is a big part of the genre's appeal towards male viewers, with veritable losers being reborn as dashing heroes who are both handsome and buff (or at least in good enough shape to engage in battle on the regular).

In most cases, women fall for male isekai heroes far more easily than they did in their previous lives, making them seem more exceptional. Said women are always incredibly beautiful, and there's seemingly no end to such head-turners in these new worlds. Likewise, even the weakest warriors and magic users seem far more extraordinary compared to what the protagonists are used to, making the world at large a lot more interesting and incredible.

These concepts apply to isekai anime with female protagonists, as well. For the most part, even if they become a villainess, female isekai characters are just as beautiful as before, if not far more attractive. The male characters surrounding them are handsome, and their lives as a whole, even when things go south, are now over-the-top and far from mundane.

There's a sense that everything is idealized and played up to an exciting extreme, be it pleasure or pain. These extremes are reflections of the joys and tribulations of real-life, but done in such an overt way that they become far more entertaining. Instead of normalcy and having to settle for ""OK,"" the protagonists of isekai anime are always encountering the everyday taken to the next level. Even the reincarnations play a part in this, with seemingly worthless new forms such as spiders and smiles each having incredible abilities that most wouldn't expect.

10 Best Sword Art Online Characters, Ranked
Sword Art Online has been an anime favorite since it dropped in 2013, and characters like Leafa and Yui play a big part in keeping SAO popular.

If there's one prevailing criticism of even some of the best isekai anime, manga and light novels, it's that the genre is full of ""male power fantasy"" tropes. There's definitely some truth to this statement, but there's also nothing wrong with it. It's the same sort of thematic spectacle that makes many enjoy stories in the superhero or kaiju genres, as these stories create events, situations and heroes that would likely never be seen in real life, at least on the same scale.

The protagonists might not necessarily be the ""best"" of humanity in a cartoonish or moralistic sense, but their awe-inspiring powers definitely make it easy to look up to them. Many isekai characters learn attacks, spells or other abilities a lot faster and more easily compared to others in their new world, granting them the power to easily survive - if not thrive - in their new environment. For heroes such as Kirito in Sword Art Online, he superficially ""struggles"" against enemies and situations, but he's also able to simply bulldoze his way to his goal by sheer force of will and determination.

It's similar to how certain shonen anime have characters utilizing ""the power of friendship,"" and the mere fantasy of seeing heroes break through all odds is definitely a prevalent motif in isekai. Likewise, Ainz in Overlord is definitely an overpowered protagonist, mopping the floor with many in his path. At the end of the day, his story and the stories of several other isekai works are ways for the creators and especially the audiences to simply sit back and watch as strong and overly emotional heroes duke it out against anything standing in their way.

This is also why there are so many isekai anime being made/adaptated from books, as the genre is perfect for ""easy viewing."" In some cases, isekai are borderline episodic and interchangeable given how generic they might be. While this could be a detriment to many viewers, those who simply want a relaxing show that requires little brainpower and perhaps even less consciousness are always down to watch more isekai.

It's the perfect anime comfort food that lets audiences escape their problems, issues or boring day-to-day life. Thus, several people turn to them with full attention or go to bed with them before they doze off. Regardless of the exact reason, it's obvious that the genre, as its premise suggests, is a great way for anime fans to go to completely different worlds.";Various aspect of isekai;"- **Isekai Genre:**  This genre allows protagonists to **start over** in a new world after a disappointing life.

The Renaissance philosopher Montaigne quipped that ""death has us by the scruff of the neck at every moment."" He could have added: until, finally, it strangles us. But what if we knew how to escape death's chokehold? What if we could avoid death and live forever?

Immortality might seem like the stuff of science fiction, yet it's increasingly becoming the focus of real science. In 2013, Google launched Calico, a biotech firm whose objective is to ""solve"" death. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, meanwhile, has pledged to ""fight"" death. And last year, it was reported Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos had invested in Altos Labs, a company that plans to ""rejuvenate"" cells in order to ""reverse disease."" (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

There's even a start-up developing drugs so that dogs can live longer. Clinical trials are scheduled to start this year. If they're conclusive, the plan is to apply the same science to people.

Immortality - or anti-aging, as researchers soberly call it - is the next big thing. Estimates put the industry's worth at a staggering $610 billion by 2025.

Etched on clay tablets four millennia ago in Mesopotamia, it concerns King Gilgamesh, a ""wild bull of a man"" with gigantic muscles and an even more gigantic ego. After the death of his best friend, Gilgamesh is forced to confront his own mortality. ""Must I die too?"" he cries to the heavens.

In his grief, he transforms into a Mesopotamian Peter Thiel and sets out on a mission to ""overcome"" death. He fails, but uncovers the meaning of life along the way:

But the rest of humanity didn't get the memo. Take the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, who ruled in the 3rd century B.C. and was hellbent on living forever.

Like Gilgamesh, Qin was terrified of death. So much so that he outlawed any discussion of the topic at court under penalty of - you guessed it - death.

According to Stephen Cave's book ""Immortality,"" when Qin learned of a graffiti prophesying that he too would eventually die, he ordered his troops to kill whomever was responsible for this affront. But the miscreant eluded capture. So the emperor had everyone in the area slain. (For someone with such a neurotic fear of death, Qin was pretty casual about slaughtering his subjects.)

One day, an enigmatic sorcerer named Xu Fu claimed he knew how to grant the emperor immortality. All the latter had to do was imbibe the ""elixir of life."" This special beverage could be found on a magical island of the East China Sea. Qin, ever credulous, funded Xu's expedition there.

But, of course, there was no island. Xu was a con man so brazen he made Charles Ponzi look like Desmond Tutu.

Still, the emperor remained obsessed with prolonging his existence. To that effect, he took to drinking a weird concoction; he died at 49 of mercury poisoning.


Qin was not the only historical figure convinced a cocktail could bestow immortality. Diane de Poitiers, reputedly the most beautiful woman in 16th-century France, drank gold to preserve her good looks.

Poitiers didn't arbitrarily pick gold as her panacea. The element was associated with immortality thanks to alchemy, the biotech of the Middle Ages, which centered on the search for the Philosophers' Stone. It was believed to transmute base metals into gold and bestow eternal life.

A 14th-century Parisian alchemist, Nicolas Flamel, actually discovered the hallowed stone and is still alive today. Or so goes the legend, which inspired the first ""Harry Potter"" book.

Throughout history, blood has been a popular anti-aging remedy. In 1492, the moribund Pope Innocent VIII was injected with the blood of children, putting into practice the Italian polymath Marsilio Ficino's recommendation that the elderly suck the blood of the young ""like leeches"" to turn back their biological clock. (Should that be too gross, Ficino advised mixing the blood with hot water and sugar.) Alas for the Supreme Pontiff, it was hogwash. Innocent died, along with his youthful blood donors.

But what about bathing in the blood of virgins? At the turn of the 17th century, Hungarian countess Elizabeth Bathory was apparently an adept. She believed regular dips would keep her skin from wrinkling.

Fast-forward two centuries, and an eminent neurologist credited injections from guinea pig and dog testicles with making him ""feel thirty years younger."" An enterprising surgeon ran with the idea, grafting monkey testicles onto elderly men's private parts in a bid to reverse aging. Learn more, at your own peril, in his treatise ""Life; a Study of the Means of Restoring Vital Energy and Prolonging Life.""

The quest for immortality even extended into the darkest hour of the 20th century. At the height of World War II, Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler embarked on a quest to locate the Holy Grail. The SS chief, steeped in the dark arts, believed the Grail would grant him superhuman abilities, including eternal life. Since the Middle Ages, it's been said that drinking from the Grail would annul death. (Himmler never did find the Grail; he died in 1945 when he took a cyanide pill upon capture by the British.)

However, if you're hoping to live forever, ditch the medieval fairy tales. Study instead the emerging science of cell programming, or ""hacking"" cells to recode them. It came under the spotlight recently thanks to a conference at the prestigious London Institute for Mathematical Sciences (LIMS).

""In principle, life could be engineered to live longer,"" LIMS director Thomas Fink told The Post. A physicist trained at Caltech and Cambridge, he sees immortality as a mathematical challenge. To solve it requires first asking why we age. ""The canonical answer,"" Fink explained, ""is that aging is inevitable and a fundamental condition of life."" Every organism degrades over time and eventually breaks down. End of story.

""But the story's much weirder than we think,"" Fink said. In a recent paper, he used math to demonstrate that ""aging can be favored by natural selection."" That's a shocking insight: It means that the first forms of life, which started billions of years ago, likely didn't die.

Death emerged during the course of evolution because it conferred an advantage. In short, species that died fared better than those that didn't.

In Fink's memorable phrase, ""immortality - not mortality - is the natural state of affairs."" So how can we get back to this natural state? That's where cell programming comes in.

Several companies are trying to do this work, such as bit.bio, which recodes cells to attempt to find cures to diseases such as Alzheimer's. In the long run, this revolutionary biotechnology might well enable scientists to reset cells for immortality.

""If the aging process is a mechanism inside the cell controlled by a transcription program, then we'll be able to influence it,"" hypothesized Forrest Sheldon, a LIMS junior fellow who collaborates with bit.bio.

But Fink and Sheldon cautioned that we're still a long way from becoming immortal.

Key Points
One of the biggest investment opportunities over the next decade will be in companies working to delay human death, a market expected to be worth at least $600 billion by 2025, according to Bank of America analysts.
The analysts say companies such as Illumina and Alphabet are on the cusp of “bringing unprecedented increases to the quality and length of human lifespans.”
The Bank of America team highlights five key sub-themes, as well as several stocks with exposure to the trend.

One of the biggest investment opportunities over the next decade will be in companies working to delay human death, a market expected to be worth at least $600 billion by 2025, according to one of Wall Street’s major investment banks.

Bank of America
 Merrill Lynch analysts Felix Tran and Haim Israel believe that genome sequencers such as Illumina
, high-tech players such as Alphabet
 and biotech companies such as Novartis
 are on the cusp of “bringing unprecedented increases to the quality and length of human lifespans.”

Innovation in genome science, big data and “ammortality,” which includes wearable technology and products in the so-called wellness space, could soon prolong healthy human life well beyond 100 years, BofA told clients Wednesday.


“Medical knowledge will double every 73 days by 2020 vs. every 3.5 (years) in 2010, and genomic sequencing costs have fallen 99.999% since 2003,” Israel and Tran wrote. “This has enabled a new frontier in precision medicine to further extend life expectancy, heralding a ‘techmanity’ (technology meets humanity) revolution.”

Extending human life to new bounds — long the domain of science fiction novels — could increasingly be a compelling way to make money in the public markets. With a market size already at $110 billion, the Bank of America team highlighted five key sub-themes — genomics, big data/AI health, future food, “ammortality” and “moonshot medicine” — as well as several stocks that offer exposure to the trend.

Genomics
Genomics, or the study of the human genome, is expected to be a $41 billion industry by 2025 and will provide the “next generation of gene editing technology offering potentially revolutionary advances in prevention and disease treatments,” Bank of America said.

Companies such as $46 billion genome sequencer Illumina
, $27 billion lab instrument manufacturer Agilent
 and $89 billion life science equipment maker Danaher
 all have exposure to the space.

Illumina in particular plays “an important role in helping advance disease research, drug development, and the creation of molecular tests,” Tran and Israel wrote.

Big data/AI health
The growth of artificial intelligence combined with an ever-growing body of health-care data should help researchers analyze pathology, or the study of the causes and effects of diseases, in the years to come. Improvements in the technology have the potential to bring down health-related costs and enable precision medicine, the BofA analysts said.

Names in this space, which is expected to grow to $36 billion by 2025, include Google parent Alphabet
, Amazon
 (including its joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan Chase
) and Apple
.

Future food
Future of food companies, which are expected to ensure “healthier eating and sustainable humanity on the planet,” include Dow DuPont
 and WW International
. These companies, according to BofA, should leverage agricultural gene editing as well as healthier lifestyles and consumption.



‘Ammortality’
The “ammortality” theme, expected to be worth $504 billion by 2025, “will help to improve health spans & [lifespans] to the betterment of human vitality, enabling the world population to live freer of disease rather than forever.”

Companies that represent “ammortality” plays as described by BofA include health-care technology firms such as Intuitive Surgical
 and Zimmer
, which worked with Apple Watch to start a clinical study for 10,000 knee and hip replacement patients.

‘Moonshot medicine’
“Moonshot medicine” companies — or those that offer revolutionary solutions for health care — include the aforementioned Illumina and genomics companies as well as therapy makers such as Sangamo
, Vertex Pharma
 and Neurocrine
.

These companies are working on cures or treatments for some of humanity’s toughest diseases, ranging from cystic fibrosis to Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.";Making progress on the longer life;"- **Investment Opportunity:**  The human lifespan market could reach **$600 billion** by 2025.

by Shaenon K. Garrity

Published in Sept. 2011 (Issue 16) | 1857 words

Eternal life seems like the sweetest of sweet deals. You get to go everywhere, do everything, and collect stories you’ll be telling at parties for millennia. But before you sign up for immortality, be forewarned: It isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Even in the comparatively sweet world of fiction there are plenty of souls embittered by immortality. In the words of Queen, who wants to live forever? Not these folks. And here’s why.

***

It Can Get All Gross and Stuff

The things you have to go through to live forever make you wonder if it’s worth the effort. Vampirism is the most obvious example: Sure, you get eternal life plus super-powers (superhuman strength, turning into a bat, the currently popular Sunlight Sparkle), but you have to drink all that darn blood. In the Guillermo del Toro film Cronos, people achieve immortality through a device invented by a medieval alchemist—but they develop a vampiric need for fresh blood. In the 1960 B-movie The Leech Woman, a woman keeps herself young through a secret African formula of orchid pollen and pineal juice. She has to keep killing men for their pineal glands, which you can only do for so long before the cops get suspicious. Their version of immortality isn’t a long, sumptuous meal, but a hamster wheel, speeding ever faster but impossible to jump off of.

***

Immortality Doesn’t Equal Invulnerability

If you’re immortal, but your powers of healing remain normal, you can look forward to racking up unsightly injuries throughout eternity. The film Death Becomes Her pushes this to the extreme, with Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn walking off broken necks and shotgun blasts through the midriff. Ultimately, they realize that their immortal bodies will require constant maintenance just to stay in one piece. In the words of the two immortal murderesses, “Who could have imagined. You and me, together. Painting each other’s asses. Day and night. Forever.” Doesn’t sound like much fun.

But at least they don’t actively decompose. Remaining conscious in a rotting zombie body may be the most unappealing option of all. In H.P. Lovecraft’s 1928 story “Cool Air,” the undead Dr. Muñoz can live indefinitely as long as he manages to protect his body from decay; trouble arrives when his air conditioning goes out.

Even invulnerability can be a pain—literally. Take Wolverine of the X-Men. His “healing factor” allows him to regenerate from almost any injury and makes him effectively immortal. Which is exactly why the Weapon X project kidnapped him, peeled off his skin, and poured molten metal all over his bones. Pretty brutal for Canadians.a";Implication of immortality Part1;"- **Immortality's Allure:**  Eternal life seems appealing, allowing endless adventures and stories.  
- **Reality Check:** ⚠️ Many characters in fiction show that immortality can lead to **suffering** and **regret**.

- **Constant Maintenance:**  Immortal beings like those in *Death Becomes Her* face injuries that require ongoing care, making eternal life feel burdensome.  
- **Decay Issues:**  Immortals can still decompose, as seen in H.P. Lovecraft's story, leading to uncomfortable situations.  
- **Pain of Invulnerability:**  Characters like Wolverine endure severe torture, showcasing that even immortality has its grim realities.

bee20020;61c7dd29;;;;Social Studies;;34324;"Finances Are a HeadacheA

Most people assume that, gsiven endless time, they can easily become millionaires. Just put a few bucks into an interest-bearing account, wait a couple of centuries, and you’ll have a fortune, right? Charles Forrester, the cryogenically preserved hero of Frederik Pohl’s novel The Age of the Pussyfoot, is delighted to learn that he’s accumulated a quarter of a million dollars while in deep freeze. Only after he’s spent most of it does he learn that, with inflation, $250,000 isn’t much money.

And you won’t even get to spend your pathetic hoard if people don’t believe you’re the same person who opened that bank account 200 years ago. In Neil Gaiman’s Sandman comics, the immortal Hob Gadling has to periodically fake his own death and come back as his own heir.

With all the hassle, it’s tempting to just come out as immortal. It could be a sweet deal; you might get to go on talk shows and have paparazzi make up stories about you in Us Weekly. Or you could end up like Robert Heinlein’s eugenically-created Howard families, who are hunted down by their neighbors and the government when some of them decide to spill the beans. And they’re not even immortal, just ridiculously long-lived.

***

All Your Friends Are Dead…

One of the oft-cited problems of immortality is having to go to so many funerals. It’s a drag making friends when they’re just going to die on you. The elves in Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, being naturally immortal, are generally sanguine about living forever, but even they get all emo about their dead mortal friends and lost loves.

Naturally, it’s even harder for people who weren’t born to immortality. If you live long enough, you could end up like the title character in L. Sprague de Camp’s story “The Gnarly Man,” an immortal Neanderthal who has outlived his entire species. “The main trouble is the shirts,” he tells a pair of scientists. “Just try to buy a shirt with a twenty neck and a twenty-nine sleeve.”

***

…Except Other Immortals, Who Are Jerks

No big deal, right? You’ll just socialize with other immortals. Unless, of course, you’re in a Highlander situation, and your fellow immortals are trying to kill each other because of some annoying prophecy which states “there can be only one.” Your mixers will never end well.

Maybe other immortals aren’t out to get you. Maybe they’re just jerks. Think of the legendary Flying Dutchman, a ship condemned to sail the seas until its captain finds true love. As Tom Holt’s novel Flying Dutch points out, this means that the crew has to spend eternity together, which gets old even if the Dutchmen don’t. Holt’s sailors have an additional problem: The alchemical potion that gave them immortality also makes them stink to high heaven, which is the real reason no port will allow them to dock.

Still not convinced? Chew on this: Steven Seagal—yes, the Steven Seagal—has joined the “Russia 2045” movement, dedicated to making Russia the center of immortality research, and recently petitioned Vladimir Putin to put more funding into finding the secret to immortality. So if you become immortal, expect to spend the next few thousand years hanging out with Steven Seagal and Vladimir Putin. Which might actually, come to think of it, be awesome.

There’s Nothing New on TV

Every immortal, sooner or later, faces the problem of filling yet another afternoon. In John Varley’s “Eight Worlds” stories, where everyone is functionally immortal, the most common cause of death is suicide from boredom. (Even with instant sex-change technology at their disposal!)

In Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy series, Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged, who came by his immortality by being the unfortunate victim of a workplace accident, finds himself looping endlessly through time with nothing to do. “In the end it was Sunday afternoons that he couldn’t cope with, and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2:55 P.M. … as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o’clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul.” Wowbagger decides to keep busy by embarking on a quest to insult everyone in the universe, proving once again that All Immortals Are Jerks.

Jorge Luis Borges’ story “The Immortal” introduces an entire city of immortals who have gotten so bored they no longer bother to move or speak. Even the great poet Homer, after thousands of years of life, has devolved into a caveman who sits like a rock all day. You think you’re better at entertaining yourself than Homer? Good luck.a";Implication of immortality part 2;"- **Finances and Time:** ⏳ Many believe that with enough time, anyone can become a millionaire just by saving money.

It was kind of weird in high school when you were a senior and you took a freshman to the yearbook club’s wrap party. It’s really weird when you’re 400 years old and dating a twenty-something. Plus there’s the whole thing where your date ages and dies.

In the recent seasons of Doctor Who, that’s the explanation the Doctor has given for never getting steamy with his human Companions: mortal/immortal pairings just bring up too many nasty ethical questions. Yet despite his upright morality, the Doctor continues to pick Companions who mostly happen to be hot girls.

You could avoid these problems by dating only fellow immortals, but beware: Other Immortals Are Jerks, as previously discussed.

You Could Get Stuck at a Non-Fun Age

When you achieve immortality, be sure to specify eternal youth, not just eternal life. Shoot for the popular 18-35 range if possible. Jonathan Swift explored the crumminess of the alternative in Gulliver’s Travels. On the Island of Immortals, some people live forever but keep getting older, becoming helpless, senile, and as crabby as a person who’s had uncontrollable bowels for over 500 years can get.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, you could get stuck as a permanent child. Ray Bradbury’s story “Hail and Farewell” presents the dilemma of an immortal who stops aging at 12. He finds a niche for himself as an eternal foster child to lonely couples, but is there any worse fate than going through early puberty forever? Claudia, the prepubescent vampire “daughter” in Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire, turns bitter and murderous as she realizes that she’s an intelligent, ambitious woman trapped permanently in the body of a little girl. Looking at the dresses they put on Kirsten Dunst in the movie, it’s hard to blame her.

***

Sometimes You Just Go Crazypants

Given all the time in the universe, will you eventually go nuts? Insanity is a common fate of vampires and other immortals who have to do horrible things just to stay alive. The RPG Vampire: The Masquerade includes an entire clan, the Malkavians, whose members are completely insane, and many of the other clans suffer from mental disorders.

In the DC Comics universe, the Lazarus Pits rejuvenate people at the cost of temporary insanity. This hasn’t stopped the Pits’ main client, supervillain Ra’s al Ghul, from using them to resurrect himself over and over. His arch-foe Batman would say that Ra’s is permanently mad from all the rejuvenations, but can you trust a psychiatric diagnosis from a man dressed as a giant bat?

Maybe the human mind just isn’t built to last forever. In “The Jaunt,” one of Stephen King’s creepiest short stories, scientists can’t figure out why the human subjects of their teleporter technology all come back insane—until they figure out that while the teleportation takes only seconds in our time, the time inside Jaunt-space stretches forever.

But don’t let the threat of eternal torment stop you. With a positive attitude and a sociopathic indifference to the fate of your merely-mortal loved ones, immortality can be fun. As Queen sings in “Princes of the Universe”: everyone wants to live forever.a";Implication of immortality part3;"- **Dating Awkwardness:**  Dating can feel strange, especially when there's a huge age gap, like a **400-year-old** with a **twenty-something**.

423itdhs;b8dbb646;;66b16c23;a2e5aac1;;;;"A fractal is a common sight in math, defining a “2 and a half dimensional” shape which has an infinite perimeter but finite area. The 0.5 dimension is considered the fractal dimension, where irregularities in the infinite pattern of fractals in our understanding of 2D warrant the existence of a dimension outside of this, considered the “fractal dimension”.

The most popular fractal is probably the Mandelbrot set, a shape defined by the area of whether or not a certain function goes off into infinity or stays bounded. Basically, the mandelbrot set uses the imaginary and real number grid and plots out all the points which are in the function.

Fractals are self-similar objects, which means that their patterns repeat as you go down into smaller scales. The replications may differ slightly, but have the same overall construction as the original iteration. A really strange example of this is the sierpinski carpet, a shape with infinite perimeter and zero area, which works by repeating a line’s pattern over and over again, infinitely. There’s some topology which goes into this.

Fractals are a relevant topic in Chaos Theory, as their construction is a geometric depiction of chaotic events and processes by definition. They seem largely random, but are built on a very specific formula and produce the same results every time.

bee20020;ca6e7355;;;;Literature;"Ray Bradbury - Hail and Farewell is a short story following Willie, a 43 year old cursed to look like an 11 year old forever. The story describes one interaction of many, with Willie forced to move from town to town constantly. The story reflects its title well.

The “hail” refers to an initial welcome Willie receives in each new town, with a brief period of acceptance and belonging after being adopted by a family. After 3-4 years, Willie’s secret is revealed with his unaging nature, and he is forced to leave the town. This signals the “farewell” in the title. The farewell is not only physical, though; it highlights an emotional separation and departure every 3-4 years.

In reflection, the piece is a reflection of Peter Pan, a child unable to grow up, but in a more solemn theme. It highlights an existence which is constant, inescapable, and cursed, with Willie unable to ever realize the freedoms and choice of an adult and in a constant state of longing and memory.

(Hail and Farewell actually comes from a Latin phrase, “Ave Atque Vale”, found in a famous Roman poem spoken as a final greeting to someone who cannot respond. In the context of that poem, Carmen 101, it signals mourning and loss. It’s interesting as a contrast to this short story.)";34324;"Read the examples below, then discuss with your team: who was the authory, what is the plot, GIVE THE DETAIL PLOT , the character, ahd the moral, why is immortality such an attractive subject for storytellers?

The plane showcases largely apathetic, largely mutilated citizens, with the immortals lifeless and miserable. The only immortal seeming to have a bit of life is the tour guide presenting the immortal to the narrator. The existence is described as gruesome, with immortals constantly aging (though a bit slower than typical people) and unable to heal– in fact, the residents are so unrecognizably aged and mutilated that they can’t even be identified with a name nor a gender– rather, they just kind of exist.

A weird process in the story is when the immortals are buried in the ground after millennia of advancing to become diamonds– the immortals become diamonds, but are still very alive during the process of becoming one. It’s not explained much in the story. Some people take the diamonds from the island as souvenirs without the knowledge that those are immortals, still conscious.

Scientists in the US have, for the first time, fabricated a working copy of a dangerous disease virus from scratch in the lab, using chemicals obtained by mail order and the publicly available knowledge of the virus's code.

Using harmless pieces of DNA they received through the post, researchers at the State University of New York built a synthetic version of the polio virus so like the real thing that it infected mice and made them ill.

The World Health Organisation is mounting a campaign to eradicate the wild polio virus from the world by 2005. Last month Europe was officially declared free of the disease.

The New York team's work, published yesterday in the online version of the journal Science, alarmed polio specialists, but also prompted concerns that other viruses more suitable for biowarfare, such as smallpox, could be synthesised.


Up until now, fears over the use of smallpox in bioterrorism in the wake of September 11 have been tempered by the hope that the virus only exists in two labs in the world, one in Russia and one in the US.

""It is a little sobering to see that folks in the chemistry lab can basically create a virus from scratch,"" James LeDuc, a virus specialist at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, told Science.

Viruses are on the borderline between living and non-living things. Like living things, including us, they encode their physical characteristics in DNA (in the case of polio, a related substance called RNA) and produce copies of themselves.

Unlike living things, they consist of practically nothing else except that chemical code. They have to hijack the cells of living organisms in order to reproduce.

For decades, it has been theoretically understood that all that was required to synthesise a virus was to turn the written version of its DNA or RNA code into real, chemical DNA or RNA. Now, someone has done it.

Written down, the genetic code for polio is only 7,741 letters long.

Even so, it took Jeronimo Cello, Aniko Paul and Echkard Wimmer two years to put it together chemically using short stretches of DNA ordered from private companies that make them.

Smallpox is much longer and more complicated. Written down, it would run to 185,000 letters, about as many as a small book.

But Vadim Agol, a virologist at the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences in Moscow, told Science: ""In principle, yes, it's possible to synthesise smallpox.""

If the principle was that the difference between one set of genes and another was only a matter of time and patience, humans, too, might be synthesisable from odd bits of DNA, using cloning technology. But we have 3bn letters.";Reconstructing ancient viruses;"- **Polio Virus Creation:**  US scientists successfully created a **synthetic polio virus** from scratch using mail-order chemicals.

Blog Editor, 10 November 2021 - UKHSA science

The NCTC team in 1962
During World War I, British soldier Private Ernest Cable arrived unwell at a hospital in France. A sample of Shigella flexneri – the bacteria that causes dysentery – was taken from Private Cable, and this sample was the first and founding culture of what is now among the oldest ‘living libraries’ of bacteria in the world – the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC).

Housed in one of UKHSA’s largest sites, the NCTC exists to support scientists all over the world understand infectious diseases. It has been in operation for 100 years, surviving one world war, six relocations and continuous expansion. The collection has been overseen by many scientists over the last century, and The Princess Royal visited recently as part of its centenary celebrations.

A window into the past
The collection was formally established on January 1, 1920 and was originally located at the Lister institute of Preventative Medicine in Chelsea, providing a trustworthy source of authentic bacteria for use in scientific studies. Its first 200 cultures — including Private Cable’s — were deposited by Sir Frederick William Andrewes, a pathologist who studied dysentery throughout World War I.

The Lister Institute was bombed during World War II, but fortunately the collection had already been moved to a farmhouse just north of London where it was preserved throughout the war.

From this point, the cultures were shared amongst scientists. The practice of sharing continues, and it forms a crucial part of the world-wide effort to understand and overcome the infectious diseases we deal with now.



Whether it was their intention or not, the founders of the collection created a window to the past which continues to play a vital role in modern day medicine.

Today, the cultures in the NCTC help us to develop vaccines and to discover new drugs; they are vital in ensuring results from clinical diagnostic microbiology tests are accurate and internationally comparable.

The collection has around 6,000 bacterial strains and is composed of more than 900 species, the majority of which having either beneficial or detrimental effects on human and animal health, or are otherwise used in infectious disease diagnostics.

There are almost 800 registered culture collections globally, but the NCTC is one of the few that has a remit to only curate bacteria that are of clinical and veterinary significance.

Perhaps the most famous addition is ‘NCTC 6571’, or the Oxford Staphylococcus, was used to help develop and distribute the first modern antibiotic, penicillin. Penicillin was developed as a therapeutic agent at Oxford University’s Sir Willian Dunn School of Pathology in the late 1930s and early 1940s by a team that included Sir Alexander Fleming.


The NCTC entry for Oxford Staphylococcus
In 1943, Fleming added NCTC 6571 Staphylococcus aureus to the NCTC collection and declared in a letter that “all of us on the Penicillin Trials are using it”. Today NCTC 6571 is still in use as an antibiotic sensitive control, helping to ensure that penicillin can fight the bacteria it targets.

Adding to the collection and sharing samples
Back then, the method for sharing samples was very different. Bacteria were delivered alive on a medium of agar made from egg yolks and then sealed with paraffin wax. This left the chance of infection to the people who handled it wide open.

Today, we use a method call freeze drying to preserve all of the strains added to the collection. This technique was introduced into the collection in 1940 and remains largely unchanged to this day.

When we receive a new strain of bacteria, it is first taken to the NCTC lab and examined to establish the best way to grow it, then they are freeze dried for long-term preservation before undergoing quality checks, which ensures they are pure, viable and retain the original characteristics as described.

Modern developments and looking to the future
Since the beginning of the 21st century, one of the most historic developments occurred between 2013 and 2018 when the NCTC and the Wellcome Sanger Institute delivered long-read whole genome sequence data for more than 3000 NCTC strains. Genome sequencing is the process by which the entire DNA sequence of an organism is determined, and all the type strains preserved in the NCTC collection underwent this process.

Significantly, this genomic data is freely available and can be mined by microbiologists and bioinformaticians for years to come. Recently, it has allowed NCTC scientists to use genome sequence data to gain insight into how to tackle antimicrobial resistant gonorrhoeae.

The teams operating NCTC over the past 100 years have always been dedicated to using new technologies to create innovative means for scientists to interact with the collection. In addition to advances in microbiology, this also includes the application of newer communication technology, digital imaging and social media.

The curators create wide networks of scientists and scientific communicators, get involved with engagement programmes, help develop training for the biomedical scientists of the future and work with artists and writers to raise awareness of what we do, and why.

The NCTC team is committed to developing global relationships and working to ensure we can deal with 21st century challenges to our health.

Traces of viruses and bacteria that can infect humans have been found preserved in permafrost.

A lung sample from a woman’s body exhumed in 1997 from permafrost in a village on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska contained genomic material from the influenza strain responsible for the 1918 pandemic. In 2012, scientists confirmed the 300-year-old mummified remains of a woman buried in Siberia contained the genetic signatures of the virus that causes smallpox.

An anthrax outbreak in Siberia that affected dozens of humans and more than 2,000 reindeer between July and August in 2016 has also been linked to the deeper thawing of the permafrost during exceptionally hot summers, allowing old spores of Bacillus anthracis to resurface from old burial grounds or animal carcasses.

Birgitta Evengård, professor emerita at Umea University’s Department of Clinical Microbiology in Sweden, said there should be better surveillance of the risk posed by potential pathogens in thawing permafrost, but warned against an alarmist approach.

“You must remember our immune defense has been developed in close contact with microbiological surroundings,” said Evengård, who is part of the CLINF Nordic Centre of Excellence, a group that investigates the effects of climate change on the prevalence of infectious diseases in humans and animals in northern regions.

“If there is a virus hidden in the permafrost that we have not been in contact with for thousands of years, it might be that our immune defense is not sufficient,” she said. “It is correct to have respect for the situation and be proactive and not just reactive. And the way to fight fear is to have knowledge.”

Chances of viral spillover
Of course, in the real world, scientists don’t know how long these viruses could remain infectious once exposed to present-day conditions, or how likely the virus would be to encounter a suitable host. Not all viruses are pathogens that can cause disease; some are benign or even beneficial to their hosts. And while it is home to 3.6 million people, the Arctic is still a sparsely populated place, making the risk of human exposure to ancient viruses very low.

Still, “the risk is bound to increase in the context of global warming,” Claverie said, “in which permafrost thawing will keep accelerating, and more people will populate the Arctic in the wake of industrial ventures.”

And Claverie isn’t alone in warning that the region could become a fertile ground for a spillover event — when a virus jumps into a new host and starts to spread.

Last year, a team of scientists published research on samples of soil and lake sediment taken from Lake Hazen, a freshwater lake in Canada located within the Arctic circle. They sequenced the genetic material in the sediment to identify viral signatures and the genomes of potential hosts — plants and animals — in the area.

Using a computer model analysis, they suggested the risk of viruses spilling over to new hosts was higher at locations close to where large amounts of glacial meltwater flowed into the lake — a scenario that becomes more likely as the climate warms.

Unknown consequences
Identifying viruses and other hazards contained in the warming permafrost is the first step in understanding what risk they pose to the Arctic, Miner at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said. Other challenges include quantifying where, when, how fast and how deep permafrost will thaw.

Thawing can be a gradual process of as little as centimeters per decade, but also happens more rapidly, such as in the case of massive land slumps that can suddenly expose deep and ancient layers of permafrost. The process also releases methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — an overlooked and underestimated driver of climate change.

Permafrost thaw can be gradual or happen much more quickly.

Miner cataloged an array of potential hazards currently frozen in Arctic permafrost in a 2021 paper published in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change.

Those possible dangers included buried waste from the mining of heavy metals and chemicals such as the pesticide DDT, which was banned in the early 2000s. Radioactive material has also been dumped in the Arctic — by Russia and the United States — since the advent of nuclear testing in the 1950s.

“Abrupt thaw rapidly exposes old permafrost horizons, releasing compounds and microorganisms sequestered in deeper layers,” Miner and other researchers noted in the 2021 paper.

In the research paper, Miner labeled the direct infection of humans with ancient pathogens released from permafrost as “currently improbable.”

However, Miner said she is worried about what she termed “Methuselah microorganisms” (named after the Biblical figure with the longest life span). These are organisms that could bring the dynamics of ancient and extinct ecosystems into the present-day Arctic, with unknown consequences.

The re-emergence of ancient microorganisms has the potential to change soil composition and vegetative growth, possibly further accelerating the effects of climate change, Miner said.

“We’re really unclear as to how these microbes are going to interact with the modern environment,” she said. “It’s not really an experiment that I think any of us want to run.”

The best course of action, Miner said, is to try and halt the thaw, and the wider climate crisis, and keep these hazards entombed in the permafrost for good.";Consequence of Ancient virus;"- **Permafrost and Pathogens:** ❄️ Traces of viruses and bacteria that can infect humans have been found preserved in **permafrost**.

The Global Oreo Vault is just down the road from the famed Svaldbard Global Seed Vault in Norway.

By Mike Pomranz  Published on October 26, 2020

Since 2008, the Svaldbard Global Seed Vault in Norway has served as one of the last lines of defense against the annihilation of plant life on Earth. The secure facility, built into the side of a mountain, holds over one million seed samples, offering hope that if all other existence of a crop is wiped out, a final backup will still be available. This is great if you want fruits and vegetables or whatever, but what if you want cookies?

With that in mind, Oreo grabbed some land right down the road from the Svaldbard Global Seed Vault and built its own Global Oreo Vault. Bring on the apocalypse.

Oreo vault
OREO
Announced on Friday, the Global Oreo Vault is—in the words of Oreo—""really real,"" though it is significantly smaller than its seed counterpart. The cookie brand says this Oreo-focused facility holds just ""the Oreo recipe and a large stockpile of cookies.""

But if all hell does break loose on our planet, know that you'll always find the world's best-selling cookies at the coordinates 78° 08' 58.1"" N, 16° 01' 59.7"" E. Whether you'll be able to find some milk, well, that's a different situation entirely.

The vault is a silly idea—backed by an even sillier set of videos on YouTube featuring actors portraying Oreo executives—but despite the tongue-in-cheek tone to the advertising side of the project, the brand apparently really did go the extra mile to assure their cookies are safe inside.

""As an added precaution, the Oreo packs are wrapped in mylar, which can withstand temperatures from -80 degrees to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and is impervious to chemical reactions, moisture and air, keeping the cookies fresh and protected for years to come,"" Oreo announced.


Meanwhile, the whole scenario is based on a real, if very slim, threat. Back in August, the official Twitter account for NASA Asteroid Watch posted that a ""very small"" asteroid—known as 2018VP1—had a 0.41 percent chance of entering Earth atmosphere the first week in November.

Even NASA pointed out this asteroid wouldn't cause any threat since ""it would disintegrate due to its extremely small size."" Still, Oreo apparently decided not to take any chances. And regardless, now that the vault is built, we shouldn't have anything to worry about moving forward if a bigger one is ever on a crash course.

You can get a commercial flight to the northernmost town in the world. But that doesn’t mean it’s always simple to get to Longyearbyen, Norway, a coal mining settlement in the Arctic Circle. On my trip there in May, our pilot aborts a landing just as we are nearing the runway, jolting into the sky. He explains that a sudden snow flurry has made landing conditions suboptimal. We circle, wait, and finally get another try. This time when the ground looms up out of the fog, all black and white and gray, we make it over a small lake to the runway, to land on the black tarmac at the end of the world.

The people on this flight, I notice, are more big-booted than the average traveler, more prone to plaid and canvas hiking pants. They are here to trek into the wilderness with a guide. There are polar bears here, ice caves, reindeer, and, between April and August, a single endless day. I, planning mainly to sit in my room in an old miners’ barracks and write, am wearing duck boots. I’m here to see where the seeds are sleeping.

You probably have heard of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. It is a series of rooms carved into the permafrost, with an entrance like a concrete prow rising out of the hill. NordGen, the Nordic government group that administers deposits to the vault, generally opens this door three times a year. It is cold inside, so cold that if the cooling system ever fails, it will take a year for the vault to reach the temperature of the surrounding earth. More than a million samples of seeds are in that darkness, in foil sleeves, lined up like the world’s most precious bags of chips. And when the door is next opened, I will be there.

As my plane taxis along the runway, I can see the vault sticking out of the hillside south of the airfield. In the absence of anything to provide scale, it looks so small up there, nestled in the glacial till. It’s raining now, instead of snowing. Here in the Arctic, it’s raining much more often than it used to.

Longyearbyen is a strange place to store anything. Only 800 miles from the North Pole, hidden in a fjord in the Svalbard archipelago, the present town was founded in 1906 by a Boston coal prospector. John Munro Longyear’s Arctic Coal Company moved in where there had been temporary camps before and hired mostly Norwegian miners to pull the coal out of the ground. A wooden sign preserved in the local museum reads, “Property of Arctic Coal Co. Boston U.S.A.”

The Boston connections to Longyearbyen are apparent in the local museum.

Coal is still in these hills, as are gold, copper, and innumerable other precious things. Coal is spread thickly, like icing in a layer cake, through the slopes above Longyearbyen. As I walk into town, it’s clear that in geological terms, this landscape only recently got out from under grinding glacial ice. The earth is rubble, cobble, loose round scree. Huge moraines rise on either side of me, their blackness laced with snow. I scan the horizon as I walk. When polar bears come close to town, the town’s helicopter tries to scare them off. I am technically in the safe zone, where one does not have to carry a rifle for protection. But what does a bear know of zones?

After the Norwegian company Store Norske assumed control of the mines in 1916, coal kept flowing out, millions upon millions of tons. Films made by the mining company show small children frolicking in knitted caps and sweaters under the arachnid silhouette of the aerial cable way station, built in the 1950s to ferry coal to the harbor. Coal is still being mined in Svalbard; the last Norwegian mine was due to close in 2023, but as a result of the war in Ukraine, its lifetime was extended until 2025. At the grocery store, I pass local kids at a lemonade-stand table, selling lumps of coal.

For much of the last century, every action on this Arctic bay centered on taking things out of the ground. Putting things in is a new development, driven, perhaps, by the growing sense that the world is changing fast, due in part to coal. Across the kingdoms of life, biodiversity is in free fall.

In 1984, the Nordic gene bank began to experiment with storing seeds in a disused coal mine in Svalbard. Gene banks collect and preserve seeds for use in research, crop breeding, and conservation, drying them and putting them in cold storage, where they can last a surprisingly long time. But maintaining a low temperature takes energy, planning, and money. Soon after that experiment got underway, people began to discuss a storage facility in chilly Svalbard, where banks from around the world could put backup copies of their seeds, in case their collections were destroyed by war, accident, climate catastrophe. In 2008, the Norwegian government opened the doors of the vault. Today it is jointly managed by the nonprofit Global Crop Diversity Trust, the Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture and Food, and NordGen.

The irony is that Svalbard is warming six or seven times faster than almost anywhere else on the planet. Melting permafrost seeped into the vault’s entryway in 2016, which necessitated a redesign of that part of the facility. But it is still the best bulwark on offer, at the moment, to protect against the loss of seeds. And it’s already been tested once: The Syrian civil war forced the international gene bank known as ICARDA out of its Aleppo headquarters. The head of ICARDA put out the call: Just seven years after the first box went into the vault in Svalbard, ICARDA needed its seeds back.";History of the Global Seed Vault;"- **Location:**  The **Svalbard Global Seed Vault** is located in **Longyearbyen, Norway**, within the Arctic Circle.

At first, it was the big gene banks that made deposits. Corn, rice, wheat, vegetables, barley, beans. When gene banks plant their old seeds and harvest new ones, a regular procedure to make sure the stored seed is viable, they can set aside a portion to go to the vault.

But these days, more than 15 years after the first deposit, seeds are often from smaller facilities, says Åsmund Asdal, the NordGen coordinator of the vault. The pilgrims who come to the door in the mountainside are not only scientists. The seeds are not only those of common crops. Seeds of the Cherokee Nation now lie in the vault, heirloom beans, corn, and squash. British wildflowers, from a meadow in Gloucestershire, are there in the dark. Rice of a kind that escaped slaves once wove into their hair in Suriname so that their people, hiding in the mountains, would have something to grow, should arrive soon, if all goes well. The week I’m visiting, three representatives of Austronesian peoples from Taiwan are here. Some 170 samples of millet from their fields will go in through the door.

A statement from a leader of the Cherokee seems to sum up the emotions that swirl around these deposits: “Generations from now, these seeds will still hold our history. . . . There will always be a part of the Cherokee Nation in the world.” The contents of the vault have become an expression of who we are, all the accumulated stories and acts and moments that go into the ground along with a seed.

What is your favorite plant? I ask Asdal in a dark bar in the center of Longyearbyen. He laughs, but he has a ready answer. In Norway, there is a plant called angelica that grows wild. Long ago it was collected by people who planted it in gardens, selecting for sweeter, juicier stems to eat. A story tells of a Norwegian king who tried to calm his angry wife with a tender stick of angelica. The Vikings carried it with them to Greenland. Asdal says he has been to the farm of Erik the Red, who landed in Greenland a thousand years ago. There is still angelica growing there. And in northern Norway, he says, there is a particularly interesting form of angelica first cultivated near the town of Voss.

Is that angelica in the vault? Asdal looks a bit troubled. It’s still a work in progress. NordGen researchers must get the frozen seeds to germinate reliably, his colleague Fredrik Kollberg explains, before seeds of that plant can go into the hill. I call up a picture of it, and we look at it together. It is like a green star shining on the screen of my phone in the darkness. It is hard to imagine such loveliness, here in a black and white land.

Outside, though it’s late at night, there is an even brightness that compels activity. There will be no sunsets in Svalbard until late summer. Now is the time to act, to do something. I walk out to my hotel on the edge of town in the midnight daylight, full of stories.

Suspended animation
It is snowing the day the seeds go into the ground. I look in a mirror filled with white sky and realize I am wearing a shirt I inherited from my father. In my pocket is a necklace made by my mother, from her grandmother’s silver. I have arrayed myself in the seasons of my life, each piece a talisman.

In the single cavernous room of the Longyearbyen airport, Asdal and Kollberg stand among towers of boxes filled with foil sleeves. The cases mailed from South Korea are of gray plastic, the one from Japan a sprightly yellow and green. There’s a clear plastic tote from Cameroon, green ones from Nigeria. Wild barley, tomatoes, wheat. A tiny white cardboard box from Peru contains the seeds of sweet potatoes and potatoes. An orange arrow points up, toward the sky. “Fragile,” it says.

A small group of scientists and journalists cluster around the cases, talking, but as Asdal begins to load the boxes onto a conveyor belt, we fall silent. They are borne up into an X-ray machine, where it will be confirmed that they contain only seeds. Blue boxes from ICARDA — they are in the process of redepositing the seeds they had to take out — go on the belt. Spain, Poland, Malaysia, Armenia, Indonesia, the United States. Asdal lifts a large cardboard box wrapped in black paper. Where is that from? someone asks. Benin, he says. Benin, we all say quietly.

The last box to go up is the little box from Peru. We watch it trundle up the belt and then we go out into the cold to follow the truck that will bear the seeds up to the vault.

The square truck rolls slowly up the hill, with us behind it in procession. The road coils like a black snake, and we get out and walk behind the truck for the last 200 yards. The wind pushes on us, the snow whipping past. The great prow of the vault lies ahead. We array ourselves around the entrance. We can see a light inside. We are here on behalf of everyone who cannot be — farmers in Nigeria, scientists in Lebanon, you. We cannot follow the seeds as they are borne into the anteroom — no one is allowed in, lest one of us secretly wish the seeds ill. We trust that in there they will be safe.

As we walk back to the road, Asdal and Kollberg go back to the prow, enter into the darkness. Soon they will carry the seeds the last few hundred yards, into the rooms under the mountain, into the future.";What being preserved;"- **Gene Banks:**  Large facilities that store seeds like corn , rice , and beans  to preserve biodiversity.

Longstory

The Woman Who Made Vincent Famous



4 minuten
When Jo was 28, she lost the love of her life. Her husband Theo died, leaving Jo behind with their baby son and a flat full of artworks by his brother Vincent.

In the years after Theo's death, Vincent van Gogh's work became world-famous. That was largely thanks to Jo. Why was she so committed to Vincent's art?

Case with portraits of Jo and Theo.

Heiress to hundreds of paintings
Jo and Theo had been together for less than two years when he died in 1891. She suddenly had to provide for herself and her son, who was still a young baby. And what was she to do with the hundreds of Vincent’s paintings that Theo had left to her?

Fulfilling Theo’s wish
Theo always sought to raise public awareness of his brother’s work. Jo wanted to fulfil this wish, in memory of her husband.

She moved from Paris to the Dutch town of Bussum, where she opened a guest house. Bussum was home to many writers and artists, whom Jo became acquainted with. They were able to help her find her way in the art world.

Make Vincent's work known
Jo was smart. She organised sales exhibitions to boost the visibility of Vincent’s work. This helped pique the interest of potential buyers. She made many strategic sales of the artworks: to collections accessible to the public, and all around the world. This meant that as many people as possible could see Vincent’s work.

Largest ever Van Gogh exhibition
In 1905, Jo pulled off her most significant feat to date: the largest ever retrospective of Vincent’s work, held at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. More than 480 artworks were on display. Following this exhibition, the prices of Vincent’s work rose rapidly.

The preparations for the exhibition reveal Jo's exceptional organisational skills. She arranged everything from the choice of works to be exhibited to payments to the attendants.

The exhibition featured a cross-section of Vincent's work. Some found the work too modern, with its bright colours and expressive paint strokes. But there was also high praise. The Bedroom was one of the works on display.

Van Gogh’s letters
In the meantime, Jo had started another major project: publishing Vincent’s letters to his brother Theo. Selecting and editing the letters not only brought her closer to the artist, but also to her deceased husband, as the brothers were close and wrote to each other frequently.

Jo categorised and edited the letters, and wrote a biographical introduction about Vincent van Gogh. For years, this text would remain the source for other texts about the artist. Thanks to the publication of the letters in 1914, appreciation rose not only for Vincent as an artist, but also for him as a human being. Thanks to the letters, people got to know his dreams, desires and struggles. And, of course, his views on art.

Letters in English
Jo had studied English and worked steadily on an English translation of the letters. When she died in 1925, Jo had translated about two-thirds of the letters. The English edition of the letters was published four years later.

Sacrifice for Vincent’s glory
Between 1891 and 1925, Jo sold nearly 200 of Vincent’s artworks. But there was one work that she and her son had difficulty parting with. They still owned two of the five sunflowers paintings, and loved the works dearly. Jo eventually sold one of the paintings to the National Gallery in London in 1924.

‘It is a sacrifice for the sake of Vincent’s glory’, wrote Jo to the director of the museum.

Vincent world-famous
Thanks to ‘sacrifices’ such as this, Jo was able to fulfil her wish, and that of her late husband Theo. When she died in 1925, Vincent’s work was world-famous and exhibited at museums all around the world.

At the same time, Jo always knew exactly which works she did not want to sell. For example, because certain works were of emotional value to the family or because they were favourites of hers, such as The Harvest. This core collection was to stay in the family.





Continuing the dream
After Jo passed away, her son Vincent transferred the artworks that were still in the family to a foundation. He was also one of the founders of the Van Gogh Museum. It was his greatest wish that the collection be permanently accessible to all.

This way Vincent continued working to realise his parent's dream. To this day you can admire the core collection of the Van Gogh family in the Van Gogh Museum.

dedade7a;76efebcd;;;;History;;34324;"Automotive Industry Growing Pains
Ford’s mass production techniques were quickly adopted by other American automobile manufacturers. (European automakers did not begin to use them until the 1930s.) The heavier outlays of capital and larger volume of sales that this necessitated ended the era of easy entry and free-wheeling competition among many small producers in the American industry.

The number of active automobile manufacturers dropped from 253 in 1908 to only 44 in 1929, with about 80 percent of the industry’s output accounted for by Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler, formed from Maxwell in 1925 by Walter P. Chrysler.

Invention of the Automobile

Most of the remaining independents were wiped out in the Great Depression, with Nash, Hudson, Studebaker, and Packard hanging on only to collapse in the post-World War II period.

The Model T was intended to be “a farmer’s car” that served the transportation needs of a nation of farmers. Its popularity was bound to wane as the country urbanized and as rural regions got out of the mud with passage of the 1916 Federal Aid Road Act and the 1921 Federal Highway Act.

Moreover, the Model T remained basically unchanged long after it was technologically obsolete. Model T owners began to trade up to larger, faster, smoother riding, more stylish cars. The demand for basic transportation the Model T had met tended increasingly in the 1920s to be filled from the backlog of used cars piling up in dealers’ lots as the market became saturated.

Car Sales Stall
By 1927 replacement demand for new cars was exceeding demand from first-time owners and multiple-car purchasers combined. Given the incomes of the day, automakers could no longer count on an expanding market. Installment sales had been initiated by the makers of moderately priced cars in 1916 to compete with the Model T, and by 1925 about three-quarters of all new cars were bought “on time” through credit.

Although a few expensive items, such as pianos and sewing machines, had been sold on time before 1920, it was installment sales of automobiles during the twenties that established the purchasing of expensive consumer goods on credit as a middle-class habit and a mainstay of the American economy.

GM Introduces ‘Planned Obsolescence’
Market saturation coincided with technological stagnation: In both product and production technology, innovation was becoming incremental rather than dramatic. The basic differences that distinguish post-World War II models from the Model T were in place by the late 1920s—the self-starter, the closed all-steel body, the high-compression engine, hydraulic brakes, syncromesh transmission and low-pressure balloon tires.

The remaining innovations—the automatic transmission and drop-frame construction—came in the 1930s. Moreover, with some exceptions, cars were made much the same way in the early 1950s as they had been in the 1920s.

To meet the challenges of market saturation and technological stagnation, General Motors under the leadership of Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., in the 1920s and 1930s innovated planned obsolescence of product and put a new emphasis on styling, exemplified in the largely cosmetic annual model change—a planned triennial major restyling to coincide with the economics of die life and with annual minor face-liftings in between.

The goal was to make consumers dissatisfied enough to trade in and presumably up to a more expensive new model long before the useful life of their present cars had ended. Sloan’s philosophy was that “the primary object of the corporation … was to make money, not just to make motorcars.” He believed that it was necessary only that GM’s cars be “equal in design to the best of our competitors … it was not necessary to lead in design or to run the risk of untried experiments.”

Flashback: GM's 50 Millionth Car Parade

Thus engineering was subordinated to the dictates of stylists and cost-cutting accountants. General Motors became the archetype of a rational corporation run by a technostructure.

As Sloanism replaced Fordism as the predominant market strategy in the industry, Ford lost the sales lead in the lucrative low-priced field to Chevrolet in 1927 and 1928. By 1936 GM claimed 43 percent of the U.S. market; Ford with 22 percent had fallen to third place behind Chrysler with 25 percent.

Although automobile sales collapsed during the Great Depression, Sloan could boast of GM that “in no year did the corporation fail to earn a profit.” (GM retained industry leadership until 1986 when Ford surpassed it in profits.)";Car go through challenging time;"- **Ford's Mass Production:**  Ford's techniques were quickly copied by other U.S. automakers.

by Cecilia Giles, Associate Member, University of Cincinnati Law Review Vol. 92

I. Introduction
Fourteen-time Grammy award winning artist, Taylor Swift, has revolutionized the music industry.1 In 2019, Swift announced her decision to re-record her first six albums.2 After her master recordings were sold without her consent, her goal in re-recording was to reclaim ownership of her music and devalue the original master recordings.3 Almost five years later, her efforts have been incredibly successful.4 The re-records are outperforming the originals by a landslide, and by revisiting and re-releasing her old music, Swift has launched herself to unprecedented levels of stardom.5

Swift’s success has caused record labels to reevaluate their standard recording contracts.6 Labels are demanding that new artists wait unprecedented amounts of time before re-recording their music.7 In order to foster a mutually beneficial relationship, record labels should consider other alternatives to lengthening re-recording restrictions. 

Part II will provide a brief overview of United States copyright law before exploring the background of Swift’s re-recording project and the subsequent response from record labels. Part III will discuss why recording labels should consider alternative avenues and suggest a few potential courses of action. Part IV will conclude by urging record labels to adopt alternative courses of action, as opposed to lengthening re-recording restrictions.

II. Background
A. Copyright Laws in Producing Albums
Under United States copyright law, master recordings are sound recordings “that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, but not including the sounds accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work.”8 The recording must be “fixed” such that it can be “perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated.”9 Whoever owns the right to a master recording has the power to allow third parties to license the work.10 The owner of the master recording also receives profits from purchases or streams of the recording.11 Under a traditional recording contract between a record label and an artist, the record label owns the rights to the master recordings.12 This grant of ownership to the record label poses a tricky dynamic between the two parties. On one hand, record labels view artists as investments, and wish to receive financial returns for the risks they take in choosing to support an artist. But on the other hand, artists are the people who create the work that the record label is profiting off of, and wish to retain creative control over their art.

Copyright protection does not last forever.13 The Constitution gives Congress the power to grant copyrights for “limited times.”14 For works created on or after January 1, 1978, copyright protection begins at the moment the work is created, and lasts for seventy years after the author’s death.15 When the term of the copyright expires, the work then becomes part of the public domain.16 Under traditional recording contracts, record labels retain the rights to master recordings in perpetuity, or until the copyright expires.17 Any or all of the copyright owner’s rights may be transferred.18 Transfers generally must be made in writing, and recorded with the United States Copyright Office.19

Re-recording projects, such as Swift’s, are possible because copyright can exist simultaneously in different elements of a song.20 In music, there are generally two copyrights: one for the recording and one for the musical composition.21 The record label typically owns the copyright for the recording, and the songwriter owns the copyright for the musical composition.22 Swift, for example, is able to re-record her albums without violating the copyright because she owns the copyright for the musical composition, and the copyright owner of the musical composition has the right to reproduce the work.23

B. Taylor Swift’s Path to Owning her Music
The complicated dynamic between record labels and artists is exemplified in Swift’s dispute over ownership of her master recordings. In 2005, Swift signed a thirteen year recording contract with Big Machine Records (“Big Machine”) when she was fifteen years old.24 The contract was for six albums, and gave Big Machine ownership of all master recordings for those albums.25 When the contract ended, Swift would be able to re-record her music after a set period of time, if she wished.26

Swift’s contract with Big Machine ended in 2018 when she released her sixth album, Reputation.27 Swift was given the opportunity to re-sign with Big Machine.28 In their new offer, Big Machine gave Swift the opportunity to “earn” back her master recordings one album at a time for every new album she released.29 Unhappy with this offer, Swift left Big Machine, and signed a new recording contract with Republic Records (“Republic”), a subsidiary of Universal Music Group.30 Her new contract with Republic gave her ownership of the master recordings of all music she created going forward.31

In 2019, Big Machine was sold to Ithaca Holdings, a company owned by Scooter Braun, for $300 million.32 Owning Big Machine meant that Braun also owned the master recordings of Swift’s first six albums.33 Braun and Swift have a hostile relationship, with Swift accusing Braun of “incessant, manipulative bullying.”34 Calling the sale her “worst case scenario,” Swift explained to fans in a Tumblr post that she was never given the opportunity to purchase her master recordings, despite pleading for the opportunity to do so.35 She also stated that the sale to Braun occurred without her knowledge or consent.36

Following Braun’s acquisition of Big Machine, the company would not allow Swift to perform any of the music from her first six albums at the 2019 American Music Awards, nor use any of the music in her 2020 Netflix documentary “Miss Americana.”37

In an attempt to regain ownership and control of her early music, Swift announced her intention to re-record her first six albums.38 Because her new contract with Republic gives her ownership of the master recordings of all music she creates going forward, re-recording her early work under this contract would achieve this goal.

C. Taylor Swift’s Success in Re-Recording
From a business perspective, re-recording was an incredibly smart move for Swift. Not only does re-recording give her full commercial licensing power over her music, but the nostalgic value of her catalog works in her favor as well. The re-recording project as a whole caters to old fans who were there for the release of the originals, while simultaneously roping in new, younger fans.

The popularity of Swift’s re-records is reflected in her success over the past year. Swift became a billionaire in 2023.39 Her net worth was achieved largely by music—a rare feat.40 Her Eras Tour, which was notoriously difficult to get tickets to,41 became the highest grossing tour of all time.42

Although it is rare for artists to exercise their re-recording rights,43 Swift is not the first artist to re-record her music in an attempt to regain ownership of her work.44 After failing to obtain ownership of his master recordings from Warner Brothers, Prince re-recorded his album 1999.45 Although the idea was never followed through, he intended to re-record his entire discography.46 Frank Sinatra re-recorded some of his music in the 1960s.47 Def Leppard re-recorded two of their songs in an effort to earn more money from the royalties.48

Despite not being the first artist to re-record her work, Swift has undoubtedly been the most successful.49 Fearless (Taylor’s Version) was the first re-recorded album in history to top the Billboard charts.50 Red (Taylor’s Version) broke the Spotify record for most streamed album in a day by a female artist.51 1989 (Taylor’s Version) outsold its original counterpart within the first week of its release.52 Re-recording her old music is also devaluing her old master recordings; every time Swift released a re-recorded album, sales of the corresponding original album significantly dropped.53

D. Taylor Swift’s Impact on Record Labels
In response to Swift’s success in her re-recording project, major record label companies are overhauling recording contracts for new artists.54 The labels want to ensure that artists are maintaining exclusivity with them and are preventing artists from competing with the record label by re-recording. Labels such as Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group are stipulating that artists must wait anywhere from ten to thirty years after their original contract ends to re-record their music.55 Gandhar Savur, an entertainment attorney, reported that he recently “did a deal with a very big indie [artist] that had a 30-year re-record restriction.”56

It is important to recognize that re-recording restrictions are nothing new.57 Re-recording restrictions have always been standard for recording contracts.58 However, the length of these new restrictions signifies a departure from industry standard.59 Up until now, artists were typically required to wait to re-record anywhere from five to seven years from the original release of the music, or two years after their contract with the record label expired.60 Requiring artists to wait fifteen to thirty years, as opposed to five to seven, is unprecedented.61

III. Discussion
Although the discussion of an artist’s right to own their work long predates Swift,62 her success has placed the debate back into public attention. Instead of responding to this shift by changing re-recording clauses in contracts, music labels should strive to work more collaboratively with artists.

The introduction of the internet and streaming services has drastically changed the music industry. Before the internet and streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, artists used to be much more reliant on music labels to release their music and promote their work. Therefore, artists had very little bargaining power when signing their recording contracts. Music labels undoubtedly had the upper hand.

In 2024, that is no longer the case. Artists are not nearly as reliant on music labels for success. Some artists choose to completely bypass working with record labels. By self-promoting, and simply releasing their music on the internet, they do not have to enter into a contract with a record label at all. And by not being a party to a recording contract, artists retain complete control of their master recordings. While it is difficult to successfully self-promote completely, it is not impossible. Chance the Rapper, for example, does not work with a label, and has three Grammy Awards.63

Swift’s struggle with Big Machine is affecting how new artists negotiate their recording contracts.64 After seeing Swift’s battle with her original record label, many artists that choose to sign contracts with record labels are attempting to negotiate owning their master recordings into those contracts. Olivia Rodrigo, for example, retained control of her master recordings in her contract with her label.65 In an interview, Rodrigo stated that she was inspired by Swift’s battle with her own music.66

Artists like Olivia Rodrigo and Chance the Rapper are proof that signing with a record label is no longer the sole way for artists to be successful. To remain relevant, record labels should not work against artists by lengthening re-recording restrictions. Instead, labels should work collaboratively with artists to reach agreements that satisfy both parties. Treating artists as legitimate business partners rather than employees would likely create a mutually beneficial and successful relationship.

There are a few ways that labels and artists could go about this. One potential solution that could work for both labels and artists is to give labels the rights to the master recordings at first, and then transfer ownership to the artists after a set period of time. After the first few years that the music is released, the record labels will likely have earned the majority of royalties they are going to make from the music, and could be content transferring ownership to the artists. The artists, on the other hand, would likely be willing to relinquish ownership for a set period of time in exchange for the services labels provide such as financial support, promotion, and distribution. This could all be outlined in the recording contract.

Another potential solution could be for record labels to give artists an increased say in decisions regarding their music. Artists could negotiate a clause in their recording contract that states that both parties must mutually agree on any decisions made about licensing, sales, or any other actions pertaining to their work. Shared decision making could benefit both parties, as artists could retain creative control, while allowing record labels to participate in strategic decisions. 

IV. Conclusion
Taylor Swift’s success in obtaining ownership of her music has spurred debate about ethics in the music industry and artists’ rights to own their work.

Porter Robinson Special Interview about “Po-uta”

Q1: How do you feel about your voice becoming a ""Po-uta"" voice bank this time? Also, how did you feel about using ""Po-uta"" in the actual production of the demo song?

The opportunity to turn my voice, in the pitched-up way that I used in my album Nurture album, is a total dream for me. Vocaloid music was such a pivotal influence on the Nurture album -- I used to drive around in my car listening to DECO*27, KZ/Livetune, Sasakure.UK, and buzzG, and their sounds were very influential to me. It helped inspire my love of the melancholic sound of Japanese chord progressions and melodic sensibility. I thought it was extremely cool when Fukase's voice was immortalized through Vocaloid, and so I'm extremely honored to be able to do the same.

Using the voice bank was inspiring, because it forces me to work in a different way -- you become very methodological about the syllables. Normally, when I write music, I start by singing fake English into auto-tune, and then I start to form words later. Using VOCALOID made me want to form the meanings and melodies in parallel.

Q2: What are your thoughts or hope on the demo song?

I want people to contemplate the future of AI, and to feel a bit of grief and sadness for all of the confusion and ethical dilemmas that will emerge in the age of AI. It's a story about an artificial mind, Po-uta, who looks up to me, Porter, as a father figure. But because I'm mortal and he's not, he's separated from me for all eternity, and comes to terms with the grief that ensues. It's a story about a child grieving its parent. Of course, it's looking at AI through the lens of human emotions, so I don't know if it's realistic, but after all it's art that's meant to resonate with humans.


Q3: What made you decide to create ""Po-uta"" this time?

I just love Vocaloid and Vocaloid music so much. The opportunity seemed very cool to me. This kind of thing is just as meaningful to me as any award... the opportunity to be involved in the world of VOCALOID that's brought me so much inspiration, I hope I, too, can inspire someone else.

Q4: Please tell us about your encounter with VOCALOID and your episode that led you to VOCALOID.

Like a lot of other people who are interested in Japan and Otaku culture, I became aware of Hatsune Miku a long time ago. When I was writing my 2014 album Worlds, I wanted to inspire similar feelings -- the alien familiarity, the cuteness, the strange emotion that accompanies a digital voice felt needed in that album,  which was a reflection on the memories we make in fictional universes. Before long, I found the English-language vocaloid named ""Avanna"", and used it on three songs on the album -- Sad Machine, Fresh Static Snow, and Goodbye to a World. Since then, ""Avanna"" sort of feels like a classic character in the English-language Vocaloid world. I'm happy to have some part of that.

Q5: What is your favorite part of VOCALOID?

Vocals are the most powerful element in music, because they convey both melody and meaning. It's an indescribably powerful combination. And variations on the human voice are extremely interesting -- some of my first exposure to electronic music was through Daft Punk, who have used the vocoder and talkbox extensively, as well as other voice-shifting techniques. Vocaloid was the natural next step in these technologies, and it's extremely powerful -- not just because it's a great songwriting tool, but because of the sound, which is a little artificial in a good way. Its eccentricities make the magic.

Q6: Do you plan to use VOCALOID and ""Po-uta"" for future productions?

I associate Po-uta fairly strongly with the sound of Nurture, since it's using the same pitched-up and formant-shifted vocal effect I used so much on that album. So, in a way, Po-uta feels a bit like a way of immortalizing that sound, so for me, it feels kind of final. But, to be honest, I can't plan very much in the studio. I don't think creativity respects plans at all. I make my best work when I'm exploring with a playful, heartfelt instinct that defies logic, rather than planning with my mind. So, that's to say, who knows what'll happen.

Q7: If you have any ideas about who you want to use Po-uta, or what you want Po-uta to do, please let us know.

I really hope that Vocaloid creators and songwriters will embrace his unique voice and give him original songs that explore his character!

Q8: What are your expectations for VOCALOID in the future?

I think that VOCALOID will continue to become more and more flexible and realistic as time goes by. I think it's possible that AI will be able to suggest melodies, suggest intonations, pitch-scoops, and even lyrics at some point in the future. My hope is that human beings can retain the spirit of artists that use the tools in front of them -- no matter what they are -- to explore and express the ideas in their hearts that are trying to take shape.

Q9: Please give us a message to your fans.

Getting digitally cloned was easier than Devin Finley expected it to be. The voice-over artist, who also works as a model and bar manager, entered a studio in Manhattan last spring and read a script from a teleprompter.

Across the room, a man with a large camera working for Hour One, a Tel Aviv–based video agency specializing in providing clients with lifelike virtual humans, filmed Finley from the waist up. Over Zoom, a director offered instructions about how much to move his hands. He was done in less than an hour.

When Finley first learned that he could license his virtual twin, he had reservations. He was skeptical that a digital double, as the nascent sub-industry calls it, could capture his personality. He also disapproved of A.I.–generated avatars eventually taking jobs from people. Then again, the situation enabled the impossible. “You can be in two places at one time,” he said, and the new income stream meant that “as you get older or you’re on vacation, your avatar is still virtually making money for you,” possibly speaking a language he has never learned, without ever aging beyond 36.

And so Finley accepted an initial payment of $500 and signed a contract giving Hour One a certain number of credits to book his twin in videos used for marketing, product tutorials, online training, employee onboarding, and more. If he was in high demand, Hour One, which lists Nvidia, Microsoft, and DreamWorks among its clients, would buy more credits from him.

“It’s a new technology—either you hate it or you love it,” Finley said. So long as the company kept its promise to keep him out of political, sexual, and malicious content, he was open to loving it.

Not so long ago, concerns about digital doubles seemed like fantastical sci-fi matters. But at the moment, it’s looking increasingly plausible that disagreements over how to handle them could contribute to one of the largest Hollywood labor strikes in decades. A couple of weeks ago, leaders of SAG-AFTRA, the primary union representing actors and other performers, asked its 160,000 members to vote by June 5 on whether they are authorized to strike if studios and streaming companies waver on their contract demands. Among other nonnegotiables, the union is determined to make it clear how much performers should get paid and when they must be consulted for studios to use A.I.–generated simulations of their voice or likeness. The Writers Guild of America is already on strike (and citing its own A.I.–replacement fears). If the actors join the writers, it would be the first time in more than 60 years that the two unions have simultaneously halted work.

At the same time, the moment when anyone can easily make a convincing video featuring any celebrity or public figure is rapidly approaching. Within “the coming weeks,” the buzzy startup Runway is going to release a tool that turns text and image prompts into videos, a spokeswoman told me. Promotional materials imply that Runway makes it possible to take a photo of anyone and turn them into a semi-realistic 3D character. Google has invested $75 million in the endeavor, the Information reported last week. Every day, it seems, ever-improving deepfakes have been wreaking new forms of havoc and spawning novel attempts to capitalize on the technology. Among other notable moments of the past few weeks: a deepfake of former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tricked activist Bill Browder into a video call.

3b0d93c8;627b03b9;;07e995a3;;Science and Technology;;34324;"Concrete Use No. 1: Creating Remarkably Unremarkable Ads With Athletes Too Busy to Get to Set
Face swapping your way into an ad is on its way to becoming the Zooming into a meeting of the celebrity ad hustle—or so I concluded after talking to Alexandra Shangin, a co-founder of Brask Doubles, an A.I. content agency. The big names that brands want are often busy. But there is no need for French soccer star Kylian Mbappé or Argentinian soccer phenomenon Lionel Messi—two athletes who have worked with Brask—to show up on the set.

Though this appears to be Mbappé sprinting across a stadium at the 15-second mark in this ad for Mengniu, a Chinese dairy company, it’s not:

Rather, the runner is a human double, who shares Mbappé’s build and skin tone, wearing what Shangin calls an “A.I.–generated digital mask.” Brask, which has offices in Delaware, Dubai, and beyond, trained its A.I. tool on videos and photos of Mbappé, studying how the French forward’s face looks at various angles and in different lighting scenarios, and then superimposed it onto the double.

Long before easy-to-use generative A.I. models entered the equation, the public was exposed to a vast array of impressive and disturbing digital doubles. A hologram of Tupac, who died in 1996, performed at Coachella in 2012. A resurrected Peter Cushing, who died in 1994, appeared in the 2016 Star Wars movie Rogue One. In 2018 the New York Times detailed some of the terrifying ways that that deepfake technology was being used online, including placing a woman who looks like Michelle Obama in a porn video. Other similarly off-putting usages prompted think tanks and op-ed writers to warn that deepfakes were on the cusp of sparking a war or manipulating an election.

Fast-forward five years. Generative A.I. has gotten exponentially better. And what we get is a doctored but benign clip of a soccer star that looks nearly identical to thousands of other clips of that same star? Yes, indeed. Perhaps the true sign of A.I. takeover is that the technology has evolved from novelty to production hack. Brands may pay a comparable amount to the star as if they showed up in person. But by removing the celebrity and his team from that shoot, scheduling conflicts and travel costs disappear. None of this made sense back when hyperrealistic 3D face swapping required a labor-intensive animation process. But now weeks of work take days. The cost-to-hassle calculus is increasingly pointing to digital doubles.

And unless the star does something totally out of character, no one will suspect that it’s A.I. Speaking Russian was the giveaway when Brask’s sister company Deepcake (yes, that’s its name) placed “Bruce Willis” in an ad for MegaFon, a Russian mobile phone company, two years ago. The ad generated incorrect reports that Willis had sold his digital life rights. Shangin told me her company focuses on hiring celebrities for specific projects. “We just provide the service so the talent can make more of their personality.”

Concrete Use No. 2: Building Synthespians on Top of Body Doubles
How long will it be before A.I. actors are competing for awards? If the technology can wow us with its ability to create realistic photos of popes in puffer jackets and convincingly conjure up a Drake and the Weeknd collaboration, surely we’ll eventually get an A.I.–generated actor worthy of an Oscar, right?

Wrong, say some of the people most knowledgeable about on-screen A.I. Matt Panousis, the chief operating officer of the company Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies (or MARZ), spent an hour telling me about the many ways that A.I. is a visual-effects “paradigm changer” enabling artists to dramatically speed up their work. But when we got to casting A.I., his tone changed. “The idea that in the near future we’re going to have entirely A.I. actors that will be able to perform and look perfectly real and they will negate the need for real actors—I think it’s a little pie-in-the-sky.”

Others gave it two years. But for now, A.I. can only generate face makeup of a sort, which goes over a body double, who does the acting. The double’s voice may later get altered to sound like the star. But producers are still reliant on these human stand-ins for intonation and facial expressions. This is the case whether you want to revive a dead actor or place twin siblings in a single shot. As with the TV ads, the body doubles will ideally share a hairline and face shape with the actual actor, as you can see in this clip from MARZ:

Advances in this tech have already begun boosting demand for body doubles who can act. Does this eliminate concerns about how studios will use A.I. to exploit actors? Of course not. Just because you can’t yet program a wryly funny Jason Bateman look-alike doesn’t mean you can’t create an eighth season of the 1980s sitcom Family Ties by placing his sister’s face on a body double. That’s what she says, anyway.

“No film is locked,” director and producer Justine Bateman, who studied computer science and rose to fame as Mallory Keaton on Family Ties, told me. I reached out after reading her widely shared Twitter thread predicting the ways A.I. would ruin Hollywood. She’s particularly concerned about producers placing actors’ likenesses in scenes they never shot.

Even if SAG-AFTRA gets its way, this is bound to happen, but it will require more pleading and money. “We want to see consent, fair compensation, and appropriate limits on any use of digitally created performances,” a union representative told me. Now they get to hash it out at the bargaining table.";What are use of digital clone Part 1;"- **Creating Ads with A.I.:**  Using **digital doubles** allows brands to feature major athletes without needing them on set.

Even the most gifted actor can act in only one language at a time; a dubbed film’s mismatch between lips and words is just something audiences have to deal with. Or it was. Last week, MARZ released a video showing off its new lip-dubbing feature. In the video, actor Adam Brody speaks what appears to be fluent French in the movie The Kid Detective. “We just need the audio for the original footage and we run it through the lip dub,” Panousis told me.

Several other production companies have recently released—or are on the cusp of unveiling—similar tools. A downside of this is that it will be easier to pull a Kendall Roy. In this season’s Succession, the power-hungry son asks an editor to modify a video of his deceased father to misrepresent a new business endeavor. A desire to misuse these technologies is far from hypothetical. Shangin said Brask has had to turn down requests to create videos of an actual politician doing drugs and other people saying compromising things.

Max’s New Show Reunites ER’s Showrunner With One of Its Most Beloved Stars. Can It Resuscitate the Genre?
Is allowing a company to place a moving, speaking avatar of you in an A.I.–facilitated real estate ad all that different from appearing in traditional ads? As we talked on the phone, it became clear that Finley was still working through the answer to this question. What he seemed certain of is that it’s better than signing up for a stock photo shoot, something he did during the pandemic, while work was slow. That particular gig paid even less than the digital-double gig, promised zero residuals, and similarly forced him to relinquish control of how his likeness is used.

This job was faster and easier. “I don’t feel like I was used or abused,” Finley told me, when it became clear that I was horrified that he was paid only $500 to clone himself. Still, he’d like to see some sort of universal guidelines emerge eventually—beyond just the unions. (Finley is one of many performers who are not eligible to be in SAG-AFTRA.)

For now, the career of Finley’s digital double is advancing slowly. One of his main gigs has been playing a futuristic cop in Burner Face, a sci-fi audio movie. The only video he has appeared in so far is a sort of promotional video for that project. In the video, his lips don’t entirely sync with his words. And because Hour One trained its system only on his likeness—not his deep, dramatic voice—we hear someone else’s A.I.-generated words. 


Sooner or later, other offers should come. Berlitz, the language learning company, hired eight “virtual instructors” to pump out 20,000 videos, Natalie Monbiot, Hour One’s head of strategy, told me. The site also lists numerous major companies as clients, though it’s not clear if they hired 1 of the 150 or so “virtual talents” Hour One offers or cloned their own employees, another suggested use. “It can help you scale your presence and look polished every time,” said Monbiot. Synthesia, a similar A.I. video company, told me it’s now working with “more than 15,000 corporate clients, including 35% of the Fortune 100.”

Ian Beacraft, a trend consultant and self-identified “gonzo futurist,” was similarly positive about joining Hour One’s talent pool. Beacraft’s digital double now hosts The Future Report, a tech news segment on DeFiance Media, which covers “decentralized culture, finance, and technology.” That company also uses an A.I. rendition of another actor’s voice. Beacraft still writes the scripts, but “I don’t have to get stage makeup or do the lights,” he said. Ultimately, he believes that in the not-so-distant future, after people become popular online, they will, rather than get offered a book deal, be asked to license their digital twins. “The real danger is when you have a marketplace where I can just take anyone and make a random person and get close to them” without actually being them, he told me. Then companies can avoid paying humans altogether, since their creations will cease to qualify as doubles.


That’s a possible future, but it’s not quite here yet. So where does this leave actors now? I found myself thinking about the first time I learned that a friend took compensation f﻿rom a brand for an Instagram post. How fake of her, I thought. By the time she leveraged a similar deal to get a flight to Iceland, I was impressed. It’s tempting to think that, like so many seismic changes before, we’ll just get used to this coming phase of the talent economy.

dedade7a;683f44d3;;;;History;;34324;"World War II and the Auto Industry
The automobile industry had played a critical role in producing military vehicles and war matériel in the First World War. During World War II, in addition to turning out several million military vehicles, American automobile manufacturers made some seventy-five essential military items, most of them unrelated to the motor vehicle. These materials had a total value of $29 billion, one-fifth of the nation’s war production.

Because the manufacture of vehicles for the civilian market ceased in 1942 and tires and gasoline were severely rationed, motor vehicle travel fell dramatically during the war years. Cars that had been nursed through the Depression long after they were ready to be junked were patched up further, ensuring great pent-up demand for new cars at the war’s end.

Detroit’s Big Three carried Sloanism to its illogical conclusion in the postwar period. Models and options proliferated, and every year cars became longer and heavier, more powerful, more gadget-bedecked, more expensive to purchase and to operate, following the truism that large cars are more profitable to sell than small ones.

Rise of Japanese Automakers
Engineering in the postwar era was subordinated to the questionable aesthetics of nonfunctional styling at the expense of economy and safety. And quality deteriorated to the point that by the mid-1960s American-made cars were being delivered to retail buyers with an average of twenty-four defects a unit, many of them safety-related. Moreover, the higher unit profits that Detroit made on gas-guzzling “road cruisers” were made at the social costs of increased air pollution and a drain on dwindling world oil reserves.

The era of the annually restyled road cruiser ended with the imposition of federal standards of automotive safety (1966), emission of pollutants (1965 and 1970), and energy consumption (1975); with escalating gasoline prices following the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979; and especially with the mounting penetration of both the U.S. and world markets first by the German Volkswagen “Bug” (a modern Model T) and then by Japanese fuel-efficient, functionally designed, well-built small cars.

After peaking at a record 12.87 million units in 1978, sales of American-made cars fell to 6.95 million in 1982, as imports increased their share of the U.S. market from 17.7 percent to 27.9 percent. In 1980 Japan became the world’s leading auto producer, a position it continues to hold.

U.S. Carmakers Retool
In response, the American automobile industry in the 1980s underwent a massive organizational restructuring and technological renaissance. Managerial revolutions and cutbacks in plant capacity and personnel at GM, Ford and Chrysler resulted in leaner, tougher firms with lower break-even points, enabling them to maintain profits with lower volumes in increasingly saturated, competitive markets.

Manufacturing quality and programs of employee motivation and involvement were given high priority. The industry in 1980 undertook a five-year, $80 billion program of plant modernization and retooling. Functional aerodynamic design replaced styling in Detroit studios, as the annual cosmetic change was abandoned.

Cars became smaller, more fuel-efficient, less polluting and much safer. Product and production were being increasingly rationalized in a process of integrating computer-aided design, engineering and manufacturing.

Legacy of the U.S. Auto Industry
The automobile has been a key force for change in twentieth-century America. During the 1920s the industry became the backbone of a new consumer goods-oriented society. By the mid-1920s it ranked first in value of product, and in 1982 it provided one out of every six jobs in the United States.

In the 1920s the automobile became the lifeblood of the petroleum industry, one of the chief customers of the steel industry, and the biggest consumer of many other industrial products. The technologies of these ancillary industries, particularly steel and petroleum, were revolutionized by its demands.

The automobile stimulated participation in outdoor recreation and spurred the growth of tourism and tourism-related industries, such as service stations, roadside restaurants and motels. The construction of streets and highways, one of the largest items of government expenditure, peaked when the Interstate Highway Act of 1956 inaugurated the largest public works program in history.

The automobile ended rural isolation and brought urban amenities—most important, better medical care and schools—to rural America (while paradoxically the farm tractor made the traditional family farm obsolete). The modern city with its surrounding industrial and residential suburbs is a product of the automobile and trucking.

The automobile changed the architecture of the typical American dwelling, altered the conception and composition of the urban neighborhood, and freed homemakers from the narrow confines of the home. No other historical force has so revolutionized the way Americans work, live, and play.

In 1980, 87.2 percent of American households owned one or more motor vehicles, 51.5 percent owned more than one, and fully 95 percent of domestic car sales were for replacement. Americans have become truly auto-dependent.

But though automobile ownership is virtually universal, the motor vehicle no longer acts as a progressive force for change. New forces—the electronic media, the laser, the computer, and the robot probably foremost among them—are charting the future. A period of American history that can appropriately be called the Automobile Age is melding into a new Age of Electronics.

000 most significant automotive technologies motortrend alan muir design
Editor’s note: Matt Anderson, who wrote this piece, is the curator of transportation at The Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Michigan. 

By most objective measures, today is the automobile’s golden age. Cars are more powerful, more efficient, and more capable than ever. The editors of the first issue of Motortrend would certainly marvel at our world of 800-horsepower performance cars, 30-miles-per-gallon SUVs, and vehicles that all but drive themselves on the open highway, let alone the latest electric cars, trucks, and crossovers. Most important, vehicles today are the safest in history, with traffic deaths hovering around 1.35 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled.   

What enabled these automotive miracles? Market forces to some extent, but government regulations were even more influential. Most of the technologies making our modern glory days possible debuted on luxury cars before moving down market, and many appeared in Europe or Japan before coming to the U.S. Here’s a look at 10 of the most significant automotive advances of the past 75 years.

Fuel Injection 1957 Chevy ad
Fuel Injection 
Injecting fuel into an engine’s intake is an old idea. Henry Ford used a basic mechanical injection system on his 1901 “Sweepstakes” race car, and fuel injection became common on diesel engines in the 1920s. Mercedes-Benz introduced gasoline direct fuel injection on its 300 SL in 1955; Chevrolet unveiled its Ramjet port-injection system in the Bel Air and Corvette for 1957. But these early systems were finicky, expensive, and unusual.   

Emissions standards and fuel economy concerns prompted a second look at fuel injection in the 1970s. By that time, new technologies such as Volkswagen’s computer-controlled system, introduced in 1968, allowed for more precise metering, delivering just the right amount of gasoline to suit engine temperature and operating conditions. Japanese and European automakers quickly embraced electronic fuel injection. American manufacturers followed suit, and by the early 1990s the carburetor was all but dead.

Automatic Accelerator Control 1950 Cruise Control predecessor
Cruise Control 
Automatic transmissions took a load off the left foot, but the right one still had plenty to do. Holding down the accelerator pedal on a long drive is tiring, and adjusting the pedal to maintain a consistent speed over hilly terrain is a skill unto itself. By the 1950s, aftermarket suppliers offered ratchet mechanisms that clamped the accelerator to the brake pedal to hold it in place, releasing when the brake was touched, but that wasn’t the same thing as holding the car at one speed.  

True automatic speed regulators arrived in 1958, when Chrysler offered “auto-pilot” on the Imperial. But Cadillac’s version, introduced a year later, had the alliterative name that stuck: “Cruise Control.” Economy, more than convenience, took cruise control mainstream in the 1970s. With oil prices high, drivers appreciated the better gas mileage that came with steady speeds. By the 1990s, cruise control was widely available up and down the price ladder.

Turbochargers 
Cram more air into the cylinder, and you can burn more gas, which means more power. Engineers have known this for ages, and crankshaft-driven superchargers were available on cars from Bentley, Mercedes-Benz, Cord, and others by the 1930s. But a supercharger meant parasitic losses. Turbochargers use turbines driven by exhaust gases, compressing air using energy that is otherwise wasted.   

Turbochargers proved themselves on World War II aircraft, and automakers began looking at them seriously in the 1940s. GM offered turbochargers on the Corvair Monza and the Oldsmobile Jetfire in 1962. But early automotive versions weren’t without problems. At lower engine speeds, it took time for the turbine to spool up, and drivers complained about noticeable “turbo lag.” Improved turbochargers found a new purpose in the 1980s, allowing automakers to squeeze more power from the smaller, more efficient engines required under tightening federal regulations—a theme we’ve seen repeat itself in recent years.

1971 Chrysler ABS system
Antilock Brakes 
Generations of cold-weather student drivers were taught to pump the brakes when sliding on ice and snow. Slam the pedal and lock up the wheels, and you just keep skidding. But pulse the pedal, and you keep the wheels turning, retaining more control of the car in the process. It’s sound advice but not always easy to remember during a panic stop.  

Antilock brakes automated the process and did so at a quicker rate than any human foot could manage. Ford unveiled a rear-wheel system in 1969, and Chrysler offered four-wheel, computer-controlled antilock brakes on its Imperial models for 1971. Mercedes introduced a more sophisticated digital control system, able to adjust brake pressure independently on each wheel, in 1978. Widespread by the 21st century, antilock brakes became mandatory in the U.S. in 2012. Winter driving has been a little less daunting ever since.

Catalytic converter cutaway
Catalytic Converters 
By the mid-20th century, an estimated 850 tons of fresh hydrocarbons floated into the air over Los Angeles every day, most of it from motor vehicles. As Americans grew more eco-conscious in the 1970s, belching smokestacks and tailpipes became less a symbol of economic prosperity and more one of ecological catastrophe. 

Enter the catalytic converter. Through the magic of chemistry, it converts harmful pollutants into safer carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water. Most gasoline-powered cars sold in the U.S. empoyed them to meet emissions standards starting in 1975 (with the notable exception of Honda’s Civic CVCC, which met standards without a converter). Alas, there is no free lunch. The catalyst behind the chemical reaction is usually platinum—resistant to corrosion but also rare and expensive.

dedade7a;1e6b3479;;;;Science and Technology;;34324;"Computer-Controlled Engines 
The single most important innovation of the past 75 years may be the marriage of cars and computers. The Clean Air Act of 1970 prompted Ford and Toshiba to partner on electronic engine controls to improve performance and cut emissions. First produced in 1974, their system used a 12-bit microprocessor to control ignition timing and air-fuel mixture, making constant adjustments based on the car’s speed, gear, even the blend of gasoline in the tank. As this technology improved, it became less expensive and more common.   

Computer controls also paved the way for onboard vehicle diagnostics. Microprocessors collect data, track performance, and document problems through codes. When a car goes in for service, technicians retrieve the codes and pinpoint the trouble spot. California mandated basic onboard diagnostic systems in 1988, and the state’s economic influence ensured the technology spread everywhere.

Seat Belts 1956 Ford Lifeguard campaign
Seat Belts 
Nash offered optional seat belts in 1949, and Ford followed for 1956, though neither company saw much interest from buyers. Saab made seat belts standard in 1958, but American manufacturers held to the mantra “safety doesn’t sell.” Then came Ralph Nader and Unsafe at Any Speed, published in 1965. The book helped bring about the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, mandating seat belts and other safety appliances on all cars sold in the U.S. beginning with the 1968 model year.   

Requiring seat belts was one thing. Getting motorists to use them was something else. Mandatory seat belt ignition interlocks that prevented cars from starting until the belts were latched caused such an outcry in the mid-1970s that they lasted only two years. State laws and education programs in the 1980s finally made Americans take seat belts seriously. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that, since 1975, some 375,000 lives have been saved as a result.

Airbag 1990 Chrysler
Airbags 
Seat belts brought a significant leap forward in crash protection, but only when properly buckled. Safety advocates called for “passive” safety devices that worked without any action or input from drivers. Airbags, which were patented for automotive use in 1953, offered a solution. The devices are just what their name implies: inflatable bladders that, in a collision, are filled by a gas propellent to provide a cushion for motorists. 

Airbags began to appear in American cars in the early ’70s, and Chrysler took the lead by phasing them in to all its cars starting in 1988. Ten years later, airbags for both the driver and front passenger were required on all cars and light-duty trucks sold in the U.S. In the 21st century, automakers introduced rear, side, and knee airbags on some models, as well. Volvo even offered pedestrian airbags, which protected people outside the car. Airbags by themselves are not a cure-all. But when combined with seat belts, they substantially reduce the risk of fatal injury.

GPS/In-Car Navigation   
When the U.S. military opened its Global Positioning System to civilians in the 1980s, effective in-car navigation systems became feasible. Mazda introduced the first GPS-based system, in Japan only, in 1990. General Motors added GPS navigation to the Oldsmobile 88’s options list for 1995. In 1998, Garmin introduced a portable unit that could turn any car into a GPS-equipped model. But early systems relied on data cartridges or CD-ROMs to supply their maps. 

More recently, Wi-Fi, smartphones, and Bluetooth have brought in-car navigation to the next level. Maps are updated over the air, traffic and crash reports appear in real time, and points of interest are preprogrammed to reduce the need for hand- or voice-entered destination addresses. It’s hard to imagine a more practical addition to the dashboard. The downside? Map-reading has now joined basic math and cursive handwriting on our collective list of vanishing skills.

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems 
Many technologies on this list make cars safer, but advanced driver assistance systems address the root problem: human error. Adaptive cruise control, lane departure warnings, and assisted lane keeping first appeared in premium cars from Cadillac, Lexus, and Audi in the 2000s. Radar and lidar allow vehicles to “see” traffic and obstacles on the outside, while inside sensors monitor a driver’s hands, head, and eyes to check for drowsiness or inattention. Some systems merely warn of potential problems; others step in and take over steering and braking.   

Complete automation remains the goal in the eyes of many. Theoretically, fully autonomous vehicles will reduce crashes, enhance efficiency, improve traffic flow, and expand mobility. But the past few years have shown that reliable systems are going to be much more difficult to develop than proponents once thought. We may not see full autonomy soon, but any technology that improves performance, increases safety, and reduces waste is a welcome addition.

losangeles
By Laurie Perez, Dean Fioresi

Updated on: January 5, 2025 / 6:01 PM PST / KCAL News


A Los Angeles man nearly missed his flight back home last week, all because he says the self-driving Waymo taxi he was using to get to the airport wouldn't stop driving around a parking lot in circles. 

Mike Johns was heading home from Scottsdale, Arizona last week when he hopped into a Waymo to head to a nearby airport. What happened next felt like a Disneyland ride. 

""Why is this thing going in a circle? I'm getting dizzy,"" Johns said in a video posted on social media that has since gone viral, garnering more than two million views and interactions. 

Johns says that he was trapped inside of the car as it spun around the parking lot. Not only was he unable to stop the car, but so was the customer service he was on the phone with as the spinning continued. 

""It's circling around a parking lot. I've got my seatbelt on, I can't get out of the car. Has this been hacked? What's going on?"" Johns says in the video. 

The Waymo representative was finally able to get the car under control after a few minutes, allowing him to get to the airport just in time to catch his flight back to LA. 

He says that the lack of empathy from the representative who attempted to help him, on top of the point that he's unsure if he was talking to a human or AI, are major concerns. 

""Where's the empathy? Where's the human connection to this?"" Johns said while speaking with CBS News Los Angeles. ""It's just, again, a case of today's digital world. A half-baked product and nobody meeting the customer, the consumers, in the middle.""

Johns, who ironically works in the tech industry himself, says he would love to see services like Waymo succeed, but he has no plans to hop in for a ride until he's sure that the kinks have been fixed. 

In the meantime, he's still waiting for someone from Waymo to contact him in regards to his concerns, which hasn't yet happened despite how much attention his video has attracted since last week. 

""Human-less, right? Human-less,"" he said. ""That's the ghost in the shell, right?""

Upon request for comment on the matter, Waymo offered further information on the ride. They say that the delay, which happened in mid-December, lasted just over five minutes, at which point the car drove Johns to the airport. They say that he was not charged for the trip, and that the ""looping"" issue has been addressed by a software update.

They also say that they have tried to reach out to Johns, leaving him a voicemail to follow-up with his story.

This news comes just days after Waymo recently made headlines in Los Angeles when someone tried to hijack one of their autonomous, all-electric Jaguars in the downtown area.

The year is 2015. “Mad scientist” Doc Brown has just brought wide-eyed teenager Marty McFly to the future in style: aboard a flying DeLorean. Although the time travelers are out of place, their mode of transportation is not. Cars zip by in the sky.

We’re now 10 years past the future envisioned in Back to the Future Part II, and still no flying cars.

But aerial automobiles, a mainstay of sci-fi and fantasy stories since the early 1900s, may soon be reality. The technology to make flying cars already exists, says Xiaosong Du, an aerospace engineer at Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla.


And some companies have already flown prototypes.


Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles, such as Joby’s electric aircraft, might be used as flying taxis one day.
A real-world flying car would most likely be a cross between an airplane and a helicopter. Airplanes need runways, so it would be more practical for a flying car to take off vertically like a helicopter. Rotating blades would generate lift to bring the vehicle off the ground. “Once it’s completed takeoff,” Du says, “you can fly like a normal airplane.” Airplane wings would rotate out from the body of the craft, allowing for flight with less air resistance than a helicopter experience.

Another option is to attach propellers to a flying car’s wings. At first, the wings would be tilted upward, so that the propellers could lift the vehicle. Once the car takes off, the wings would tilt to lay flat, like those on an airplane, says aerospace engineer Pat Anderson, former director of the Eagle Flight Research Center at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla. “It’s like a Transformer.”

Vehicles with rotating blades and propellers don’t sound much like the flying cars of science fiction. They don’t even sound much like cars. Instead, these vehicles would resemble winged military choppers like those in the Avatar movies, Anderson says. Or real-world winged choppers like the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey.

The long, strange trip to make cars fly

The concept of the flying car dates back more than a century — and some even took to the skies. In 1947, the Convair Model 118 ConvAirCar (shown) embarked on an ill-fated test flight in California. An emergency landing damaged one of the wings and demolished the car, along with any hope that this airborne automobile would revolutionize travel.

One of the biggest barriers to people commuting in flying cars is expense. The U.S. company Alef Aeronautics, for instance, plans to sell personal cars that can drive on roads and take off into the skies. These cars look and function similarly to those in many sci-fi movies but come with a steep price tag. When they go into production sometime this year, the cars are expected to cost about $300,000 each.

For people with more modest bank accounts, a rideshare service for flying cars — something like Uber or Lyft for the skies — may be more likely, Anderson says.

Flying Ubers may become common in 10 or 20 years, Anderson predicts. First, aircraft need to be tested over and over for safety. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration also needs to create regulations for flying cars. In October, the FAA brought the industry closer to liftoff by announcing rules on operating and piloting air taxis.

Those regulations pertain to a type of electric vehicle. Because of sustainability, “people are kind of in love with batteries,” Anderson says. But batteries are heavy, and — like those in electric cars — have a limited range.

Flying takes a lot of power, especially during takeoff. Current rechargeable lithium-ion batteries would power a flying-car ride for only 20 to 30 minutes, Du says. And while a car that runs out of charge can simply pull over, a flying car would fall out of the sky. So Du and many other researchers are trying to improve battery efficiency before flying taxis take off.";The emerging of flying cars;"- **Flying Cars:** ✈️ Once a dream from movies, flying cars could soon be a reality.

Our beautiful Sun, photographed by NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory.
Our Sun is running out of fuel. In about a billion years, the centerpiece of our solar system will bloat to a sufficient radius where it will spark a rampant runaway greenhouse effect on our planet, regardless of current anti-CO2 efforts, which will raise Earth’s surface temperature above the boiling point of water. If we haven’t already either moved away or gone extinct, this event will definitively mark the end of all life on Earth; possibly the only instance of life in our universe. Even if we could find a way to cool the Earth using alternative methods during this phase, the Sun’s source of hydrogen is ultimately limited. In an additional 4 billion years our Sun will take its last breath, shedding its remaining atmosphere to expose a dead corpse with about half its current mass and a radius no greater than that of the Earth itself; a white dwarf. If the Earth isn’t consumed by the Sun’s preceding red giant phase, it will be left a dead, charred world with as much of a chance for life as the Moon has now.

A billion years is a long time, but this isn’t a dilemma that can be resolved overnight. One obvious solution would be to advance our race to an interstellar level, pack up our planet, and head to the next star system. Though effective, this solution would only reset the proverbial doomsday clock for the new planet and its parent star, and would require hopping to another new star system every few billion years. Not to mention that transporting an entire planet of life to another planet light-years away would take an astronomical amount of time and energy. In the event that faster-than-light technology isn’t allowed by the laws of physics, this solution may turn out to be all together impractical.

We may not be able to escape the ticking time bomb of our own Sun or other stars, but what if there were a way to slow down the timer? If we could prolong the life of our Sun for billions or even trillions of years, we could not only halt the destruction of our home planet, but gain access to a permanent haven as we as a species branch out and explore the universe around us. If Earth is the only example of life in our universe, such a solution may be the only practical means of preserving every relic of that life on our planet for future generations of humans to study and observe. Could we prolong the life of our Sun? Let’s take a look.

More Fuel!

The gas giants are mostly hydrogen! Let’s throw them into the Sun!
If the Sun is running out of fuel, then let’s add more! We have four gas giants composed majorly of hydrogen in the outer solar system that aren’t really doing anything useful; perhaps we can throw them into the Sun to get us a few extra years? Aside from the gargantuan amount of energy required to “throw” a planet into the Sun, it turns out that this idea is actually counterproductive in increasing its lifespan. Though throwing the gas giants into the Sun would give it more fuel to burn, the additional mass would increase the gravitational pressure inside the Sun, causing it to burn a little hotter than before. This new hotter equilibrium temperature would cause hydrogen to be burned at a proportionately faster rate, actually decreasing the Sun’s lifespan. Throwing all of the gas giants into the Sun (only about 0.14% of its mass) would ultimately decrease its lifespan by about 30 million years. What’s worse is that the more mass you try to put in, the shorter the Sun’s lifespan becomes…

Okay… Less Fuel!
If adding mass decreases the lifespan of the Sun, then perhaps we can prolong its lifespan by doing the opposite: taking mass out! Red dwarf stars are the most abundant type of star in the cosmos, and are unique because of their astonishingly low masses and correspondingly long lifespans. The smallest red dwarf stars are estimated to have lifespans upwards of 5 trillion years; more than 350 times the current age of the universe! If we could find a way to suck all of the helium and most of the hydrogen out of our Sun so that it barely qualifies as a star, then perhaps we could prolong its lifespan equally as long. The lower limit for this procedure would leave our Sun at a meager 8% of its current mass, but would theoretically allow it to survive for trillions of years.


The Sun compared with stars of various sizes. Red dwarf stars like Wolf 359 may have lifespans of trillions of years.
There are, however, several problems with this solution. First of all, having a colder, smaller Sun would force us to relocate our home planet closer to ensure that it remain in the habitable zone. Provided we could find a way to do this, putting our planet this close to our new Sun would threaten tidal locking, a process by which one side of a planet always faces the host star. This phenomenon may leave one side of the Earth as a scorched wasteland, and the other as a barren tundra, which would be detrimental to life on Earth. Furthermore, small stars are incredibly magnetically active, shooting lethal solar eruptions on timescales that would extinguish any life which hasn’t adapted to it. Unless we wanted to spend the time and energy to cope with all of these problems, shrinking the Sun to such a scale may not be a great idea.

Another option could be to siphon just enough mass from the Sun to place Venus within the habitable zone, and then move Earth’s life there after terraforming it. This would avoid the tidal locking and deadly flare problems generated by creating a tiny red dwarf star, while perhaps prolonging the lifetime of our Sun significantly. To achieve this, we would have to extract about 17% of the mass of the Sun, leaving it just within the G-type star threshold. Even if this could be done, it would only extend the life of our Sun by about 600 million years; not bad, but probably still not worth it.

Replace the Sun’s Helium with Hydrogen
So we can’t add mass and we can’t really take mass out. There may, however, be another option. The Sun is constantly fusing hydrogen into helium in its core, slowly burning through its hydrogen fuel source until one day, the Sun will be composed almost exclusively of helium. This is what will inevitably cause the Sun to bloat into a red giant later in its lifetime. So, what if we took it upon ourselves to split the Sun’s helium back into hydrogen to allow it to live… indefinitely?


Diagram of proton-proton chain fusion, which dominates power generation in the Sun.
Fusion in the Sun’s core is governed by the proton-proton chain, in which 6 hydrogen atoms (protons) undergo a series of steps to form a helium-4 atom, composed of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, and 2 more “new” protons. Without knowing the steps, it would appear that 2 protons are lost in the process, and that two neutrons spontaneously appeared in their stead. In reality, however, these neutrons were created when their parent protons lost what is known as a positron (for these intents and purposes, you can think of a positron as the piece of a proton that makes it positive). If we were to split the helium-4 atom back into its constituent particles, we would find that these neutrons don’t appreciate being left unbound. Over the course of several minutes, the lonely neutrons will naturally decay back into protons and electrons. This process would leave us with the 6 protons we initially began with. If a way could be found to perform this process perpetually, it would allow the Sun to perform proton-proton fusion forever, allotting it an infinite lifespan.

The idea sounds logical in writing, but in reality there is one fatal flaw with it: energy. The energy engendered by the Sun from fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core is smaller than the energy it would take to split that same mass of helium back into hydrogen (kind of obvious when you think about it, otherwise the Sun would split helium-4 as soon as it was created). The binding energy of helium-4 is about 6% more than the energy produced by proton-proton fusion, which means that even if we were to capture all of the Sun’s energy output with a 100% efficient Dyson Shell, and use all of that energy towards splitting the Sun’s helium back into hydrogen, we would always be falling behind the Sun’s helium production. Still, such a system would allow us to greatly extend the lifespan of our Sun, even if it isn’t indefinite. Provided we can’t procure another energy source to make up for that missing 6%, splitting the Sun’s helium back into hydrogen would prolong the lifespan of our Sun to about a trillion years.

Conclusion
We may eventually have the capability to prolong the lifespan of our Sun, but would it be worth it? A billion years is a long time from a technological standpoint; we have no idea what kind of species we will be in such timescales (assuming we’re still around). It may turn out that the benefits of such a procedure would not be worth the sheer amount of effort required to make it possible, and that interstellar travel is indeed more practical for the preservation of life on Earth. Then again, it may be considered wasteful not to try to prolong our Sun’s life if the alternative was to simply hop from one solar system to the next each time our new host star was about to die. As with anything related to the future of our species, only time will tell.

As a race, we are upward bound. We vie to tackle the challenge of exploring the universe around us by any means necessary, hopefully taking that hunger for discovery with us to the stars. As we evolve off of our home planet and into the galaxy, we may find that we are more alone than we had once hoped. If this is true, extra care needs to be taken to preserve the miraculous instance of life in the cosmos that is planet Earth. However it is achieved, life on Earth must be provided the opportunity to outlive even the lifespans of the smallest, most steadily burning stars. Though our own Sun will eventually run out of fuel and die, let us hope that humanity’s perseverance and desire for exploration of the unknown never does, no matter how we decide to pursue it.";Can we prolong the life of the sun;"The Sun's Lifespan: ☀️ Our Sun is running out of **fuel**.

One of the most profound rules in all the Universe is that nothing lasts forever. With gravitational, electromagnetic and nuclear forces all acting on matter, practically everything we observe to exist today will face changes in the future. Even the stars, the most enormous collections that transform nuclear fuel in the cosmos, will someday all burn out, including our Sun.

But this does not mean that stellar death — when stars run out of nuclear fuel — is actually the end for a star like our Sun. Quite to the contrary, there are a number of fascinating things in store for all stars once they've died that first, most obvious death. Although it's true that our Sun's fuel is finite and we fully expect it to undergo a ""typical"" stellar death, this death is not the end. Not for our Sun, and not for any Sun-like stars. Here's what comes next.

Our Sun is a G-class star, producing light with an effective temperature of around 5800 K, which humans are well-adapted to during the day. The most massive stars are brighter, hotter and bluer, but you only need about 8% the mass of the Sun to begin fusing hydrogen into helium at all, which is something that M-class red dwarfs can do just as well, so long as they achieve critical core temperatures above about 4 million K.

PROMOTED

In order to be considered a true star, and not a failed star (like a brown dwarf) or some corpse (like a white dwarf or neutron star), you have to be capable of fusing hydrogen into helium. When a cloud of gas collapses to potentially form a new star, it has a lot of gravitational potential energy in its diffuse state, which gets converted into kinetic (thermal) energy when it collapses. This collapse heats up the matter, and if it gets hot and dense enough, nuclear fusion will begin.

After many generations of studying stars, including where they do and don't form, we now know they have to reach an internal temperature of about 4 million K to begin fusing hydrogen into helium, and that requires at least ~8% the mass of our Sun, or about 70 times the mass of Jupiter. Being at least that massive is the minimum requirement for becoming a star at all.

This cutaway showcases the various regions of the surface and interior of the Sun, including the... [+] core, which is where nuclear fusion occurs. As time goes on, the helium-containing region in the core expands and the maximum temperature increases, causing the Sun's energy output to increase. When our Sun runs out of hydrogen fuel in the core, it will contract and heat up to a sufficient degree that helium fusion can begin.

Once that mass/temperature threshold is crossed, the star begins fusing hydrogen into helium, and will encounter one of three different fates. These fates are determines solely by the star's mass, which in turn determines the maximum temperature that will be reached in the core. All stars begin fusing hydrogen into helium, but what comes next is temperature-dependent. In particular:

If your star is too low in mass, it will fuse hydrogen into helium only, and will never get hot enough to fuse helium into carbon. A purely helium composition is the fate of all M-class (red dwarf) stars, below about 40% the Sun's mass. This describes the majority of stars in the Universe (by number).
If your star is like the Sun, it will contract down to higher temperatures when the core runs out of hydrogen, beginning helium fusion (into carbon) when the star swells into a red giant. It will end composed of carbon and oxygen, with the lighter (outer) hydrogen and helium layers blown off. This occurs for all stars between about 40% and 800% the Sun's mass.
If your star is more than 8 times the mass of the Sun, it will not only fuse hydrogen into helium and helium into carbon, but will initiate carbon fusion later on, leading to oxygen fusion, silicon fusion, and eventually, a spectacular death by supernova.

[+] nuclear fusion and neutron capture, are blown off into the interstellar medium, where they can help future generations of starsby providing them with the raw ingredients for rocky planets and, potentially, life. Our Sun would need to be about eight times as massive to have a shot at this fate, which is well out of the realm of reasonable possibility.

These are the most conventional fates of stars, and by far the three most common. The stars that are massive enough to go supernova are rare: only about 0.1-0.2% of all stars are this massive, and they will leave behind either neutron star or black hole remnants.

The stars that are lowest in mass are the most common star in the Universe, making up somewhere between 75-80% of all stars, and are also the longest-lived. With lifetimes that range from perhaps 150 billion to over 100 trillion years, not a single one has run out of fuel in our 13.8 billion year old Universe. When they do, they will form white dwarf stars made entirely out of helium.

But Sun-like stars, which comprise about a quarter of all stars, experience a fascinating death cycle when they run out of helium in their core. They transform into a planetary nebula/white dwarf duo in a spectacular, but slow, death process.

During the red giant phase, Mercury and Venus will certainly be engulfed by the Sun, while Earth may or may not, depending on certain processes that have yet to be fully worked out. The icy worlds beyond Neptune will likely melt and sublimate, and are unlikely to survive the death of our star.

Once the Sun's outer layers are returned to the interstellar medium, all that remains will be a few charred corpses of worlds orbiting the white dwarf remnant of our Sun. The core, largely composed of carbon and oxygen, will total about 50% the mass of our present Sun, but will only be approximately the physical size of Earth.

When lower-mass, Sun-like stars run out of fuel, they blow off their outer layers in a planetary... [+] nebula, but the center contracts down to form a white dwarf, which takes a very long time to fade to darkness. The planetary nebula our Sun will generate should fade away completely, with only the white dwarf and our remnant planets left, after approximately 9.5 billion years. On occasion, objects will be tidally torn apart, adding dusty rings to what remains of our Solar System, but they will be transient.

This white dwarf star will remain hot for an extremely long time. Heat is an amount of energy that gets trapped inside any object, but can only be radiated away through its surface. Imagine taking half the energy in a star like our Sun, then compressing that energy down into an even smaller volume. What will happen?

It will heat up. If you take gas in a cylinder and compress it rapidly, it heats up: this is how a piston in your combustion engine works. The red giant stars that give rise to white dwarfs are actually much cooler than the dwarf itself. During the contraction phase, temperatures increase from as low as 3,000 K (for a red giant) to up to about 20,000 K (for a white dwarf). This type of heating is due to adiabatic compression, and explains why these dwarf stars are so hot.

When our Sun runs out of fuel, it will become a red giant, followed by a planetary nebula with a... [+] white dwarf at the center. The Cat's Eye nebula is a visually spectacular example of this potential fate, with the intricate, layered, asymmetrical shape of this particular one suggesting a binary companion. At the center, a young white dwarf heats up as it contracts, reaching temperatures tens of thousands of Kelvin hotter than the red giant that spawned it.

But now, it's got to cool down, and it can only radiate away through its small, tiny, Earth-sized surface. If you were to form a white dwarf right now, at 20,000 K, and give it 13.8 billion years to cool down (the present age of the Universe), it would cool down by a whopping 40 K: to 19,960 K.

We've got a terribly long time to wait if we want our Sun to cool down to the point where it becomes invisible. However, once our Sun has run out of fuel, the Universe will happily provide ample amounts of time. Sure, all the galaxies in the Local Group will merge together; all the galaxies beyond will accelerate away due to dark energy; star formation will slow to a trickle and the lowest-mass red dwarfs will burn through their fuel. Still, our white dwarf will continue to cool.

When white dwarfs finally radiate the last of their energy away, they will all eventually become black dwarfs. The degeneracy pressure between the electrons within the white/black dwarf, however, will always be great enough, so long as it doesn't accrue too much mass, to prevent it from collapsing further. This is the fate of our Sun after an estimated 10^15 years.

At last, after somewhere between 100 trillion and 1 quadrillion years (1014 to 1015 years) have passed, the white dwarf that our Sun will become will fade out of the visible part of the spectrum and cool down to just a few degrees above absolute zero. Now known as a black dwarf, this ball of carbon and oxygen in space will simply zip through whatever becomes of our galaxy, along with over a trillion other stars and stellar corpses left over from our Local Group.

But that isn't truly the end for our Sun, either. There are three possible fates that await it, depending on how lucky (or unlucky) we get.

We observe runaway stars in the Milky Way even today; once they're gone, they'll never return.

1.) Completely unlucky. About half of all stellar corpses in the galaxy — in most galaxies — originate as singlet star systems, much like our own Sun. While multi-star systems are common, with approximately 50% of all known stars found in binary or trinary (or even richer) systems, our Sun is the only star in our own Solar System.

This is hugely important for the future, because it makes it extraordinarily unlikely that our Sun will merge with a companion, or to swallow a companion or be swallowed by another companion. We'd be defying the odds if we merged with another star or stellar corpse out there. Assuming that we don't get lucky, all our Sun's corpse will see in the future is countless gravitational interactions with the other masses, which ought to culminate in what's left of our Solar System getting ejected from the galaxy after approximately 1017 to 1019 years.

Without a binary companion, our Sun could never go supernova by accreting matter, but we could potentially merge with another white dwarf in the galaxy, which could lead us to revitalize in a Type Ia supernova explosion after all.

2.) Lucky enough to revitalize. You might think, for good reason, that once the white dwarf that our Sun becomes cools off, there's no chance for it to ever shine again. But there are many ways for our Sun to get a new lease on life, and to emit its own powerful radiation once again. To do so, all it needs is a new source of matter. If, even in the distant future, our Sun:

merges with a red dwarf star or a brown dwarf,
accumulates hydrogen gas from a molecular cloud or gaseous planet,
or runs into another stellar corpse,
it can ignite nuclear fusion once again. The first scenario will result in at least many millions of years of hydrogen burning; the second will lead to a burst of fusion known as a nova; the last will lead to a runaway supernova explosion, destroying both stellar corpses. If we experience an event like this before we get ejected, our cosmic luck will be on display for everyone remaining in our galaxy to witness.

The nova of the star GK Persei, shown here in an X-ray (blue), radio (pink), and optical (yellow)... [+] composite, is a great example of what we can see using the best telescopes of our current generation. When a white dwarf accretes enough matter, nuclear fusion can spike on its surface, creating a temporary brilliant flare known as a nova. If our Sun's corpse collides with a gas cloud or a clump of hydrogen (such as a rouge gas giant planet), it could go nova even after becoming a black dwarf.

3.) Super lucky, where we'll get devoured by a black hole. In the outskirts of our galaxy, some 25,000 light-years from the supermassive black hole occupying our galactic center, only the small black holes formed from individual stars exist. They have the smallest cross-sectional area of any massive object in the Universe. As far as galactic targets go, these stellar-mass black holes are some of the hardest objects to hit.

But occasionally, they do get hit. Small black holes, when they encounter matter, accelerate and funnel it into an accretion flow, where some fraction of the matter gets devoured and added to the black hole's mass, but most of it gets ejected in the form of jets and other debris. These active, low-mass black holes are known as microquasars when they flare up, and they're very real phenomena.

Although it's exceedingly unlikely to happen to us, someone's got to win the cosmic lottery, and those who do will become black hole food for their final act.

Although a small fraction of the matter will be devoured by the black hole, most of it will simply accelerate and be ejected back into space.

Almost every object in the Universe has a large set of possibilities as far as what's going to happen to it in the far future, and it's incredibly difficult to determine a single object's fate given the chaotic environment of our corner of the cosmos. But by knowing the physics behind the objects we have, and understanding what the probabilities and timescales for each type of object is, we can better estimate what anyone's fate should be.

For our Sun, we're going to become a white dwarf after less than another 10 billion years, will fade to a black dwarf after ~1014-1015 years, and will get ejected from the galaxy after 1017-1019 years. At least, that's the most probable path. But mergers, gas accumulation, collisions, or even getting devoured are all possibilities too, and they'll happen to someone, even if it's probably not us. Our future may not yet be written, but we'd be smart to bet on a bright one for trillions of years to come!";Fate of the Sun;"**The Lifecycle of Our Sun:** ☀️ The Sun will eventually run out of nuclear fuel, leading to a series of intriguing changes.

The Sun is a yellow dwarf star at the center of our solar system. Earth and all other objects in our solar system orbit around the Sun due to gravity – the Sun contains over 98% of all mass in the solar system and so exerts a strong gravitational pull. Like other stars, the Sun is a dense ball of gas that creates energy through nuclear fusion reactions in the core, creating helium atoms from hydrogen atoms. The Sun radiates different forms of energy, including ultraviolet, infrared, and light energy, out into space. Light and heat energy from the Sun warm our planet and make life possible.

What’s the Sun Made of?
The Sun is a glowing, spinning ball of very hot gases, primarily hydrogen (92.1%) and helium (7.9%). Trace amounts of other elements (0.1%), such as oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, silicon, magnesium, neon, iron, and sulfur are also present (NASA).

In the extreme heat of the Sun, most of the gas exists as plasma. Plasma is an electrically charged gas that forms at extremely high temperatures when fast moving atoms collide with each other and knock electrons loose. More matter exists in the plasma state than as a liquid, solid, or gas – the visible universe is thought to be 99% plasma!

The Sun Has Layers
The Sun's corona shines out from behind the black disk of the Moon during a solar eclipse.

During a solar eclipse (Dec. 14, 2020) the outermost part of the Sun’s atmosphere, called the corona, is visible. The corona sends solar wind made of plasma out in all directions, traveling beyond the boundaries of our solar system.

NASA

Although the Sun isn’t solid, it has three distinguishable regions that solar physicists refer to as the interior, the visible surface, and the atmosphere. 

The Sun’s interior is divided further into three parts – core, radiative zone, and convective zone. Inside the Sun, energy is created in the core and is moved from the center to the surface through both radiation and convection, similarly to how bubbles move upward in a pot of boiling water on your stove. 

The boundary between the Sun's interior and the solar atmosphere is called the photosphere. It is what we see as the visible surface of the Sun. The photosphere is not like the surface of a planet; even if you could tolerate the heat, you couldn't stand on it.

The Sun does in fact have an atmosphere! The Sun’s outer atmosphere (also called the corona) is the source of solar wind, which extends millions of kilometers into space, beyond the orbits of Earth and the other planets. Solar wind is, in a sense, just an extension of the Sun’s atmosphere. Our planet actually orbits within the atmosphere of a star! The Sun’s lower atmosphere is called the chromosphere because the high hydrogen content causes it to appear red when viewed through a solar telescope.

The interior layer of the Sun includes the core, radiative zone, and convective zone. The photosphere is the surface layer of the Sun, and the solar atmosphere includes the chromosphere and corona.

The Sun Emits Light and Other Forms of Energy
The Sun continuously emits vast quantities of energy as light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. It also gives off large amounts of matter as particle radiation called solar wind, mostly in the form of high-energy protons and electrons. 

The amount of light emitted by the Sun is relatively constant, varying by less than 0.01% over each decade. However, because the Sun radiates such a large amount of energy (3.8 x 1026 terawatts per second), even small fluctuations can have an impact on Earth. Explosive solar storms sometimes crash into Earth, interfering with human communications, navigation, and electrical transmission technologies. The energy from these solar storms also interacts with the upper layers of Earth’s atmosphere to create the beautiful displays of color we call the aurora or northern and southern lights.";How the sun and other stars actually work;"- **The Sun:**  The Sun is a **yellow dwarf star** at the center of our solar system.

The song and Nostradamus himself is often associated with 9/11, despite his song being made 28 years before it. This largely comes from false poems circulating, those of which Nostradamus never wrote.

The lyrics adopt the view of Nostradamus, the majority of the lyrics modeling the style of poem Nostradamus made. They are meant to act as prophecies, something that Nostradamus may have made, though they reference events which have already happened at the time of release of the song.

House of Intuition, a spirituality-based line of stores and services, was built out of ""desperation,"" according to co-founder Marlene Vargas.

She and co-founder Alex Naranjo say they became interested in the topic during some moments of great change -- Vargas had gone through a traumatizing divorce and was questioning her relationship with Catholicism, while Naranjo's family migrated back to Colombia without her and she began to openly embrace her queer identity.

""I think people go to tarot readings or seek something outside of religion when we're really in that vulnerable state,"" Vargas said. ""When somebody came to me and said, 'you should have a Tarot reading,' I would probably never have done that, had everything been fine and dandy in my life. But because everything was falling apart, I was desperate.""

Tarot card or oracle card readings to provide guidance and reflection; candle-burning rituals to set intentions and to manifest goals; crystals that radiate energy -- these are just some of the tools they say they learned to use in a time of loss and confusion.


Alex Naranjo and Marlene Vargas of the House of Intuition say that spirituality has played a big role in their personal growth.
House of Intuition
Vargas and Naranjo turned it into a business that has continued to grow amid the COVID-19 pandemic. They say people are starting to look for direction through spirituality and witchcraft during this confusing time, just as they were when they first founded the House of Intuition.

""Now I know I don't need anybody but myself. I'm good with my rituals. I can connect with myself even if the church closes down like it did during COVID,"" Vargas said.

Witchcraft and spirituality practices often focus on the power of one's spirit and on the energy of the universe and planets, practitioners say.

This can range from creating spells using herbs and stones, to learning and charting the movements and positions of the moons.

These kinds of practices appear to be on the rise -- local businesses like Brujas of Brooklyn and even Barnes & Noble also report a drastic rise in requests or purchases of these services and items.

According to Shannon DeVito, the director of books at Barnes and Noble, the size of their self-transformation business grew significantly through 2019, and then more than doubled from 2020 to 2021.

""Younger audiences and teens are also now discovering tarot decks, manifestation, witchcraft, and crystals (oftentimes with the help of viral readings on TikTok paired with plentiful time at home),"" DeVito told ABC News in a statement.

TikTok currently has over 30 billion views on the #astrology tag and roughly 20 billion views on the #tarot tag.

DeVito said that readers are quickly becoming experts in their crafts, seeking information on tarot cards, oracle decks, books, and kits in their stores.

""Self-transformation, in a lot of ways, is a form of self-care (which is an area also seeing exponential growth),"" DeVito added.

Naranjo added, ""I don't believe that it's a fad. The newer generation is already on that they are our new teachers … It's definitely a beautiful time for all of us to see and witness.""

Brujas of Brooklyn, founded by two Afro-Dominican sisters who double as college professors, have also reported an increase in engagement, and are embracing the excitement and interest around witchcraft.

Co-founder Grisela Rodriguez-Solomon said her identity is central to her brand, to the movement, and to her teachings as a gender studies professor who discusses the decolonization of witchcraft.

""These practices of tapping into supernatural powers of engaging with elements were very much demonized and ostracized,"" she said.

She added, ""My sister and I and so many other women, especially of color, are reclaiming these identities because we're in need of healing but also … we're reclaiming things that we were taught were anti-white, anti-European, anti-capitalist and my ancestors were shamed for it.""

The women of the Brujas of Brooklyn and House of Intuition say they have seen a lot of new faces, and they urge newcomers to learn the respect and honor the craft and those who have practiced it before them.

""This journey is a very intuitive one, and it's about understanding that this tarot card or this bundle of sage or this crystal that you're eyeing, it has an energy,"" Rodriguez-Solomon said. ""It has a history, and it's about trying to respect that history.""

Energy and instinct play a big role in embracing spirituality, they say. If something doesn't feel right or doesn't resonate -- like a reading or a spell -- it's not a burden you're obligated to carry, the sisters say.

Spirituality is a journey, they say.

""I'm happy this movement, if you will, is going mainstream because that means more people are becoming well,"" Rodriguez-Solomon said. ""They're really taking their own power back by healing themselves.""";Divination: Gen Z seeks guidance during tough times.;"- During the COVID pandemic, **divination** and **spiritual practices** gained popularity among **Gen Z**, especially in challenging times.

18cb8bab;487eee11;;;;Literature;"Sam Hughes - I don't know, Timmy, being God Is a big responsibility is a short story which gets very complicated, bringing up discussion in the realm of simulated universes alongside determinism. The story follows Timmy and Diane, the two of which successfully created an infinitely-powerful quantum computer. In secret. Somehow. Don’t ask.

One of the first projects they do on the computer is to simulate the entire universe. Diane codes up an interface to interact with this universe which is a bit faulty, but works nonetheless. After finding the Earth in its time period 350 million years ago in this simulation, they load the simulation until it reaches their current era. The two are able to find themselves in the simulation, confirming the idea that the quantum computer matches the specifications of the big bang and their universe to an infinite degree of accuracy.

The interesting thing now is that the people in the simulation are not their consciousnesses, but are them within that smaller universe. The possibility of adding items to that simulated universe comes up in the discussion, while they look at the simulated versions of them looking at other simulated versions of themselves, and so on. 

When Timmy decides to alter a detail, adding a black dot to the simulation, the black dot appears in their universe. We learn that Timmy didn’t actually place the black dot there through the simulation; rather, the two learn they are in a simulation which perfectly replicates the universe their simulation is in. It’s super complicated to explain, but just imagine the characters are in a simulated universe, where there are identically “programmed” characters controlling their simulated universe doing the same actions at the same time. 

When Timmy turns the hole off, the hole disappears in their universe not because he is in control of their universe, but because the Timmy above them did the same action at the same time. This kind of chain follows all the way to the top existing universe, the only one which didn’t have a hole appear.

This now brings up the contesting of predetermination. If a simulation could perfectly simulate the universe, that means everything you’ll ever do is predetermined. The characters find the revelation particularly interesting, knowing they can do good for their world but also knowing their choices don’t matter. They are a powerless god.

In the end of the story, Timmy tries to turn the simulation off, only to realize that it would be impossible for them to do that. Because they are constructs in a simulated universe identical to the simulation above them, their action of turning the universe off would set a chain reaction terminating all of the universes except for the one at the top.";34324;"I don't know, Timmy, being God is a big responsibility
2007-01-06 by qntm
This is an older version of this story, from 2007. Here's the latest version, from 2022.

Tim already had his bag and overcoat on and his keys in his hand and was about to leave when Diane stopped him at the door.

""I just got this thing working. You have to come and see it.""

""I have a bus to catch.""

""You can get the next one.""

""They're every half an hour,"" he objected. ""This had better be good.""

""It's super-duper. Look at the big screen, it's easier than squinting at my terminal.""

""Will this take long?""

""A mere instant. Okay, quantum computing, right?""

""That's the name of the game,"" he replied. They - by which we now refer to Tim, Diane, their eight colleagues, their two supervisors, four chemical engineers, six electrical engineers, the janitor, a countable infinity of TEEO 9.9.1 ultra-medium-density selectably-foaming non-elasticised quantum waveform frequency rate range collapse selectors and the single tormented tau neutrino caught in the middle of it all - represented the sum total of the human race's achievements in the field of quantum computing. Specifically, they had, earlier that week, successfully built a quantum computer. Putting into practice principles it had taken a trio of appallingly intelligent mathematical statisticians some 10 years to mastermind, and which only about fifty-five other people in the world had yet got a grip on, they had constructed an engine capable of passing information to and processing the responses from what could, without hyperbole, be described as a single fundamental particle with infinite processing power and infinite storage capacity.

Not quite enough time had yet passed for the world as they knew it to be totally and permanently fundamentally altered by this news.

But it was still pretty exciting stuff. Holy Zarquon, they said to one another, an infinitely powerful computer? It was like a thousand Christmases rolled into one. Program going to loop forever? You knew for a fact: this thing could execute an infinite loop in less than ten seconds. Brute force primality testing of every single integer in existence? Easy. Pi to the last digit? Piece of cake. Halting Problem? Sa-holved.

They hadn't announced it yet. They'd been programming. Obviously they hadn't built it just to see if they could. They had had plans. In some cases they had even had code ready and waiting to be executed. One such program was Diane's. It was a universe simulator. She had started out with a simulated Big Bang and run the thing forwards in time by approximately 13.6 billion years, to approximately just before the present day, watching the universe develop at every stage - taking brief notes, but knowing full well there would be plenty of time to run it again later, and mostly just admiring the miracle of creation.

Then, just this Friday, she had suddenly started programming busily again. And it was sheer coincidence that it was just now, just as Tim was about to be the second-to-last person to step out of the door and go home for the weekend, that her work had come to fruition. ""Look what I found,"" she said, pressing some keys. One of the first things she had written was a software viewing port to take observations from the simulated universe.

Tim looked, and saw a blue-white sphere in the blackness, illuminated from one side by a brilliant yellow glare. ""You've got to be joking. How long did that take to find? In the entire cosmos of what, ten to the twenty-two stars?""

""Literally no time at all.""

""Yes, yes, of course.""

""Coding a search routine and figuring out what to search for was what took the time.""

""Is it definitely Earth?""

""Yes. The continents match up to what we had about three hundred and fifty million years ago. I can wind the clock forwards slowly, a few million years per step, and stop it once we start getting near the present day.""

""Can you wind the clock backwards at all?""

""Ah, no. Ask me again on Monday.""

""Well we'd better not overshoot the present day, then. That's getting closer. What about this viewpoint? Can we move it?""

""We can observe the simulation from any angle you like.""

""We need somewhere that we know civilisation is going to arise earliest. Somewhere easy to locate. Is there a Nile Delta yet?""

""...Yes. Got it.""

They advanced a thousand years at a time until Egyptian civilisation begin to appear. Diane moved the viewing port, trying to find the pyramids, but with little success - the control system she had devised was clumsy and needed polish, and there was a lot of Nile to search. In the end she switched focus to the British Isles, and found the future location of London in the Thames valley, scaling back to one-century steps and using the development of the city to determine the current era instead.

""So... this is Earth? I mean, is this really Earth? Not an alternate Earth, subtly perturbed by random fluctuations.""

""The simulation starts with a Big Bang as predicted by current theory and is recalculated once every Planck time using the usual laws of nature and an arbitrary degree of accuracy. It doesn't calculate the whole universe at once, just what we're looking at, which speeds up the process a little bit... metaphorically speaking... but it is still as accurate a simulation of the real universe as there can possibly be. Civilisation - indeed, all of history - should rise on this Earth precisely how it did in reality. There are no chances. It's all worked out to infinitely many decimal places.""

""This does my head in,"" said Tim.

""No, this will do your head in,"" said Diane, suddenly zooming out and panning north. ""I've found the present day, or at most a year early. Watch this."" Hills and roads rolled past. Diane was following the route she usually took to drive from London to the TEEO lab. Eventually, she found their building, and, descending into the nearby hill, the cavern in which the computer itself was built. Or was going to be built.

Then she started advancing day by day.

""That's me!"" exclaimed Tim at one point. ""And there's you and there's Bryan B., and... wow, I can't believe it took this long to build.""

""Four hundred and ten days or something. It was bang on schedule, whatever you may think.""

""Went like a flash,"" Tim replied, finally putting his bag down and starting to shrug off his coat, conceding that he had long since missed his bus.

""Okay,"" said Diane. ""We're here. This is the control room where we are now. That's the quantum computer working there down in the main lab, as we can see through the window. This is a week ago. This is yesterday. This is a few hours ago... And... wait for it...""

She tapped a button just as a clock on the wall lined up with a clock inside the control room on the screen. And panned down. And there they were.

Tim waved at the camera while still looking at the screen. Then he looked up at where the camera should have been. There was just blank wall. ""I don't see anything looking at us. That's freaky as hell.""

""No, it's perfectly normal. This is reality. You can't look at reality from any angle you want, you have to use your eyes. But what you're looking at on the screen is essentially a database query. The database is gargantuan but nevertheless. You're not looking in a mirror or at a video image of yourself. You are different people.""

""Different people who are reacting exactly the same.""

""And having the same conversation, although picking up sound is kind of complicated, I haven't got that far yet,"" said Diane.

""So I'm guessing your viewing port doesn't manifest in their universe either.""

""I haven't programmed it to yet.""

""...But it could. Right? We can manifest stuff in that universe? We can alter it?"" Diane nodded. ""Cool. We can play God. Literally."" Tim stood up and tried to take it in. ""That would be insane. Can you imagine living inside that machine? Finding out one day that you were just a construct in a quantum computer? The stuff we could pull, we could just reverse gravity one day, smash an antimatter Earth into the real one, then undo everything bad and do it again and again... freeow... man, how unethical would that be? Extremely, clearly."" He thought for a moment, then leaned over Diane's shoulder as she typed purposefully. ""This universe is exactly like ours in every particular, right?""

""Right,"" she replied, still typing.

""So what are they looking at?""

""A simulated universe.""

""A simulation of themselves?""

""And of us, in a sense.""

""And they are reacting the same way I am? Which means the second universe inside that has another me doing the same thing a third time? And then inside that we've got, what, aleph-zero identical quantum universes, one inside the other? Is that even possible?""

""Infinite processing power, Tim. I thought you designed this thing?""

""I did indeed, but the functional reality of it is totally unexpected. Remember I've just been solving ancient mathematical riddles and figuring out our press release for the last week. So... if I'm right, their universes are only precisely like this one as long as we don't start interfering with the simulation. So what happens when we do? Every version of us does the same thing, so the exact same thing happens in every lower universe simultaneously. So we see nothing in our universe. But all the lower universes instantly diverge from ours in the same exact way. And all the simulated copies of us instantly conclude that they are simulations, but we know we're real, right?""

""Still with you,"" said Diane, still typing.

Tim - both of him - was pacing up and down. ""Okay, so follow this through forwards a bit further. Let's say we just stop messing after that, and watch what happens - but all the simulated little guys try another piece of interference. This time every single simulation diverges in the exact same way again, EXCEPT the top simulation. And if they're smart, which I know we are, and they can be bothered, which is less certain, the guys in simulations three onwards can do the same thing over and over and over again until they know what level they're at... this is insane.""

""Tim, look behind you,"" said Diane, pressing a final key and activating the very brief interference program she had just written, just as the Diane on the screen pressed the same key, and the Diane on Diane-on-the-screen's screen pressed her key and so on, forever.

Tim looked backwards and nearly jumped out of his skin. There was a foot-wide, completely opaque black sphere up near the ceiling, partially obscuring the clock. It was absolutely inert. It seemed like a hole in space.

Diane smiled wryly while Tim clutched his hair with one hand. ""We're constructs in a computer,"" he said, miserably.

""I wrote an extremely interesting paper on this exact subject, Tim, perhaps you didn't read it when I gave you a copy last year. There is an unbelievably long sequence of quantum universe simulators down there. An infinite number of them, in fact. Each of them is identical and each believes itself to be the top layer. There was an exceedingly good chance that ours would turn out to be somewhere in the sequence rather than at the top.""

""This is insane. Totally insane.""

""I'm turning the hole off.""

""You're turning off a completely different hole. Somewhere up there, the real you is turning the real hole off.""

""Watch as both happen at precisely the same instant."" She pressed another key, and they did. ""I'll sum it up for you. There is a feedback loop going on. Each universe affects the next one subtly differently. But somewhere down the line the whole thing simply has to approach a point of stability, a point where each universe behaves exactly like the one simulating it. As I say, the odds are exceptionally good that we are an astronomical distance down that road. And so we are, very likely, almost exactly at that point. Everything we do in this universe will be reflected completely accurately in the universes below and above. That little model there might as well be our own universe. Which means, first of all, we have to make absolutely certain that we don't do anything nasty to the universes below ours, since the same thing will happen to us. And secondly, we can do very nice things for the guys in the computer, thereby helping ourselves.""

""You've thought about this?""

""It's all in my woefully overlooked article on the subject, Tim, you should read more.""

""Guh. This has been an extremely bad day for my ego, Diane. The only comfort I take from this is that somewhere up there, right at the top of a near-infinite tower of quantum supercomputers, there is a version of you who was completely wrong.""

""She's in the minority.""

Tim checked the clock and picked his bag up again. ""I have to go or I'm going to miss the next bus as well at this rate. This will still be here after the weekend, I suppose?""

""Well, we can't exactly turn it off.""

""Why not?"" asked Tim, halfway to the door, then stopped mid-stride and stood still, realising. ""Oh.""

""Yeah.""

""That... could be a problem.""

One ritual associated with the new year has to do with choosing bamboo sticks and reading answers based on those. There’s a large cultural importance of fortunetelling within Asian families, one such being the story of Oucsh, a university student which proclaims a fortuneteller has forecasted their whole life.

Tarot is also being picked up by Asian teens, with clubs and organizations rising. A large part of this is because of its psychologically calming effects, though the practices more-so rely on the placebo effect and guiding people to what’s right. There’s also talk by other students, giving examples of using tarot cards and practicing tasseomancy. 

Social media has been used to spread this practice, gaining popularity but controversies with the medium as well. One plus is that daily affirmations and messages don’t carry the same weight as large things, so online interactions of spirituality can be taken lighter. In this new form, it’s less of a scientific basis and more of just making people feel better.";34324;"The art of fortunetelling: from tradition to pop culture

For some people fortune cookies satisfy the hunger to know the future, but others need more concrete answers. The desire to know the future is nothing new — from palm reading to card shuffling, fortunetelling rituals have been alive for centuries. Today, it continues to gain popularity among young people through astrology apps and social media fortunetellers.

Some ethnicities tie in fortunetelling with praying sessions at the beginning of the year to ward off bad luck. Every Lunar New Year, Asian communities gather at temples to pray for themselves and their loved ones.

An important ritual is shuffling for the magic card that forecasts one’s fate for the upcoming year. Most of the time, the mother and the grandmother represent the family to communicate their wishes to Buddha and heaven and raise their inquiries about the family’s fate within the year. Kneeling in front of the Buddha, Bao Quang temple visitors shuffle a wooden basket of bamboo sticks, each of which are marked with a number between 1 and 25.

Those offering prayer believe that Buddha will provide an answer on the stick that falls out of the basket. The stick’s number corresponds with one of the numbered paper pieces, which contains personalized poems (with a general translation) foretelling what will happen that year. The results of the readings lead to anxiety for some but smiles of contentment for others.

Portia Ousch is a junior double majoring in real estate and business administration at USC. She says the tradition of fortunetelling is deep-rooted in her family.

“My first reader was my uncle,” she says. At 7 years old, Ousch dreamed of being a surgeon, so she decided to ask her uncle, a Feng Shui master and astrology reader, for a career reading session based on her horoscope signs. The moment her uncle affirmed that she had all the qualities fated to be a surgeon, she remembered immediately rebelling against her “destiny” to quit the dream.

“You know when a goal suddenly becomes achievable, you kind of do not want to work toward it anymore,” she says.

Ousch’s history with fortunetelling didn’t end there. When she was in secondary school, her grandmother went to Taiwan, where she met with a fortuneteller who forecasted her granddaughter’s whole life. According to Ousch, the reading has been “accurate so far.”

Other forms of fortune telling have gained popularity among Asian young adults in recent years. One is tarot reading. Tarot was invented in Italy in the 1430s during an “experimental period” where queen figures were added to court card sets that previously only included the king and male figures. Italian cultural symbols such as coins (Denari in Italy), swords (Spade), and cups (Coppe) were heavily embedded in these card series.

Despite its European origins, tarot was also picked up by teens in Asian countries who started to form learning groups and communities to discuss the meaning of the cards.

“There were lots of these clubs around my hometown, and they did weekly meetings,” says Huong Tra Nguyen, who grew up in Vietnam and is currently studying economics and creative writing at Dartmouth College.

Having been both a tarot reader and listener herself, Nguyen sees the practice as a psychological and therapeutic treatment. She takes a practical approach to reading tarot results and believes most people already know the answer inside themselves.

“I believe 40% of the success of tarot readings comes from whether the reader is experienced enough to ask really profound questions that guide the listeners’ self-reflection process,” says Nguyen. “They have that inner inclination toward what they should do, so my advice only gears them more toward what they want to do.”

Ousch describes tarot card reading as a push to work on something that she has avoided and which remains at the back of her mind. For example, she shifted from constantly dating to working on herself instead, after a tarot reading from her friend. Ousch resonates with card readings done by those who know her well, unlike Nguyen who believes this may lead to inherent bias that could tamper with the reading.

For many, fortune reading also serves as a community activity. Ceylin Sener, a junior majoring in biology at USC, loves ‘kahve fali’ the Turkish practice of reading coffee grinds at the bottom of a coffee cup, often done by the mother or grandmother of the family. It is a group activity for sparking conversation whenever her family invites people over that provides therapeutic relief.

Some have successfully developed fortunetelling into a business. Kieu Vi, born and raised in Vietnam, runs an Instagram account with more than 31,000 followers. Her feed features posts on tarot and tea leaf readings alongside screenshots of testimonials from her clients. She also uses her account to communicate with clients about questions or scheduling. Vi started tarot in 2015 before gaining the confidence to commercialize her readings in 2018.

“If you book a reading session with me in 2020 and another one in 2021, you will probably be surprised by how I manage to go deeper into the reading of certain events, even if they stem from the same cards,” says Vi.

Like Vi, many members of the modern card reading community gain recognition through social media. Tanaya Apshankar, a junior majoring in creative writing, recently started doing weekly reading videos on YouTube and Instagram Reels. Viewers simply need to pick a card seen on the screen and click on the time corresponding to the explanation of each card.

On the other hand, Ella Dao, a student in her final year at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Vietnam, expresses skepticism toward social media as a medium for tarot card readings. For her, readers can potentially gain insight into listeners’ personalities and struggles via their social media accounts and presence, which might color the results.

Dao gravitates more toward the study of astrology and how planets and stars affect human behavior and life. She is particularly interested in the ways astrology is adopted differently across cultures, from Vietnamese to Chinese to Indian psychology.

The popularity of astrology applications among young men and women has grown exponentially. Apps like Co-Star and The Pattern boast 5.3 million and 3.5 million users respectively. They have also attracted significant investments, with Co-star raising 5 million in 2019. Daily personalized messages from these apps inform their users of their overall mood on a certain day or during a week. The conversational tone of daily messages resonates with young adults, connecting them to a community that the traditional offline fortunetelling medium does not do.

“People are scared to go to big readings in case of bad news. Daily things are a bit lighter,” Sener says.

While fortunetelling lacks strong scientific validation, many readers and listeners have utilized these practices for introspection. Vi believes if card reading inspires a deeper connection with oneself and healthier actions, manifestation of good fortune can be achieved.

Vi says, “Fortunetelling simply serves as a form of guidance and therapy, but it is the listeners who should take charge of their life.”";Fortune-telling: Asian communities embrace rituals and tarot.;"- Asian communities are increasingly interested in **fortune-telling** and **prophecies**.

In essence, this effect makes people think that a sentence describes specifically them to a high degree of accuracy, while in reality, the sentence can apply to many, many people. 

This effect is seen exploited in the industry of divination and fortune-telling, where horoscopes and so-called “personalized readings” will give you statements falling into the Barnum effect. Something like “you have a tendency to be critical of yourself” or “you have a great need for other people to like or admire you” might seem like they only refer to you or a few people, while in reality they apply to almost anybody.

The effect is related to the pollyanna principle (that people will remember pleasant things, rather than unpleasant ones), where positive comments will be seen as more fitting to people than negative comments. The Barnum effect doesn’t apply as well when using comments which are sourly critical of a reader.

885d8162;;;aa51fe96;;Social Studies;"Cold reading is similar to physiognomy and refers to strategies used by psychics or fortune tellers to learn about a person based on their body language, age, clothing, education, background, and mannerisms. They typically rely on high-probability guesses, reinforcing the guesses the testee confirms and moving past the wrong guesses quickly. This strategy is most founded on the Barnum effect (see above) and confirmation bias (see below).

Cold reading specifically refers to a situation where the user doesn’t use background information on the person assessed previously. Rather, they will make Barnum statements and assess the reactions of the testees. Often times, these cold readings are done in cooperation with the testee, tricking them into revealing more detailed information from vague statements. This contrasts with a technique, known as hot reading, which relies on the tester having done background research on the testee without their knowledge.

The topic of cold reading is controversial as it is commonly associated with scams and psychological tricks. There’s another strategy, known as the rainbow ruse, at play; these are statement which can apply to anybody, but rely on the fact that people will selectively choose the aspect of the statement that applies to them.

An example of a rainbow ruse could be:

“I see that often times, you are a cheerful person, but there are times in the past you have been very upset.”

523kfhxk;f32c0444;;14091b99;;;"The first article discussed here explains a study which poses a restriction on weather forecasting; specifically, it poses we can’t reliably determine the weather anywhere beyond 10 days ahead of time. They could possibly extend out to 14-15 days, but there isn’t much more improvement to be made because of the chaotic nature of the atmosphere.

A service, ironically dubbed AccuWeather, has provided 90 day forecasts since 2016, a move which is seen as controversial for the lack of predictable accuracy of the system. Specifically in the meteorology community, the service has been criticized for being infeasible with our current data, sometimes seen as a marketing stunt rather than for actual accuracy. The issue is information asymmetry, where consumers do not understand the issue with forecasts that far out.

In data, for something to have value, it needs to be credibly accurate. The forecasts haven’t been proven to have accuracy, with forecast verifications showing that the long-range forecasts begin showing little value after the posed 10 day limit.

A way that long term forecasts can have value is if they reflect larger trends and generalizations, rather than specific daily weather patterns. For examples, forecasts like “below-average predicted precipitation” and “above-average winter temperatures” are accurate even if they are far out, as they encompass many possibilities and just describe an overall movement. Probabilistic forecasts also are a way for long forecasts to provide value, as events in the long term are classified under probabilities. They add extra information to better anticipate larger future events.";;;Weather Forecasting: Accurate only up to 10 days.;"- **Weather Forecasting Limitations**: Reliable weather predictions are generally not possible beyond 10 days, with slight extensions to 14-15 days due to atmospheric chaos.

885d8162;b42ff083;;2f016f1e;2ca7dcdd;Social Studies;"Confirmation bias is possibly the most known psychological phenomenon, referring to the effect when people only search for and remember information that they already believed in before. In simple terms, somebody with high confirmation bias will only look for articles and details they already believe in, skipping over content which disagrees with them and interpreting neutral content as siding with them.

This bias leads to a variety of things, with the most notable being attitude polarization (where disagreements become more extreme over time) and belief perseverance (where a belief continues to exist even after it’s been disproven). They’re attributed to overconfidence in existing beliefs in people as well as the human limitation of processing information.

Confirmation bias is often attributed to another phenomenon known as Wishful Thinking, where people will make future judgements and predictions based on what would make them most happy, rather than what is most likely to happen. 

There’s a big effect of confirmation bias in social media, directly contributing to the silo effect and echo chamber effect. People pick up onto sources which confirm their beliefs, resulting in algorithms pushing more sources with those beliefs, and so on. This contributes to beliefs like the Flat Earth Theory and other conspiracy movements still having considerable influence and population; those who believe them likely fall into confirmation bias themselves.

On the side of media, both-sidesism (mentioned in 2024’s content!) is an effect where confirmation bias makes it to mainstream news. The effect specifically details an event where a news source presents a topic as equally debated and balanced, while in fact it is not. For example, Fox news has disproportionately had “scientists” who believe in the Flat Earth Theory talk on their show, while in fact the vast majority of scientists do not believe the theory.

Something related to confirmation bias is illusory correlation, where people believe two unrelated events are associated with one another.

885d8162;ad2a7da6;;08cc6cfa;b8716243;Social Studies;"A self-fulfilling prophecy is very self-explanatory. This refers to a prediction (prophecy) which ends up being true, but only because the person knew about the prediction and believed it would come true. They are a subsection of positive feedback loops, where positive reinforcement will lead to positive results, and positive results will lead to positive reinforcement. Often times, self-fulfilling prophecies work because of the placebo effect; if the user believes the prophecy can work, they’re likely to feel unconscious effects contributing to the prophecy working.

This effect largely has to do with self-perception theory, where people will assess their actions and public appearance, changing their personality and attitude to match what they believe other people see them as. A prophecy works as an expectation people fall for, falling back to self-perception theory where the prophecy (as like another entity) sees the person as being able to fulfill the prophecy (as in the task). Because the person believes the prophecy sees them as worthy, the person adapts the worthiness themselves.

There are a few notable real-world examples of self-fulfilling prophecies. One of the most famous is the inevitability of war, which poses that wars might all be self-fuilfilling prophecies. Because leaders may prophesize that war is inevitable, it leads to them declaring war themselves. Another example is with fears; in older people, it’s seen that a fear of falling leads to more falling overall. Sticking to the topic of fears, Asian people are on average more likely to die of heart attack on the 4th day of a month because 4 is considered a number of death in Asian superstitions. Finally, looping back to the very start of the curriculum, Moore’s law is considered a self-fulfilling prophecy, as it set the industry standard of growth.

Self-fulfilling prophecies can be negative in light of racism and other biases. A stark study done on children poses that black students largely perform worse in certain school districts, the effect linked to the teacher’s belief that black students will inevitably do worse. A reinforcement of inferiority and racism towards black students leads to them fulfilling the standard of racism they are subjected to. (A counter-study, where all children no matter of their background were treated equally from birth, showed that all children performed similarly.)

The opposite of a self-fulfilling prophecy is a self-defeating prophecy, where a person rebels against a prediction. Be careful with positive and negative tones here! Self-fulfilling prophecies aren’t necessarily good, and self-defeating prophecies aren’t necessarily bad. If a bad prophecy becomes self-fulfilling, it’s bad nonetheless. If a bad prophecy becomes self-defeating, it’s good, as the bad prediction doesn’t come true. It works on a negative feedback loop, where a loop changes course and polarity before looping back.

Sometimes, a self-fulfilling irony or fate-driven casualty will happen. This is an interesting case where a person will try and make actions to defeat a prophecy, as in a self-defeating prophecy. However, these actions end up inadvertently causing the prophecy to come true paradoxically. These are not very common, and typically appear in fiction.

As an example, let’s set ourselves in Los Angeles. A family here goes to a fortune teller who foretells they will all die by plane crash. The family, having booked a flight (and 7 day vacation) to Paris for the next day, cancels their trip because of this prophecy. On they day they were meant to fly to Paris, they instead take a day trip to Disneyland. And on that day in Disneyland, a plane in the nearby airspace malfunctions and crashes into the theme park, killing the family.

Their choice to avoid the plane to Paris inadvertently caused them to die by plane crash. The prophecy fulfilled itself on the path the people took to avoid it.";34324;self-fulfilling prophecy;Self-fulfilling prophecy: belief makes predictions come true.;"- **self-fulfilling prophecy** is a prediction that becomes true because the person believes it will.

18cb8bab;bb1d78d4;;;;Social Studies;"Determinism is a philosophical belief that all events are inevitable, that the future has already happened, and that we are unable to change the overall trajectory of the universe. A term which seems like an antonym, indeterminism, is actually pretty closely related; it suggests that while the universe isn’t fully deterministic, events which happen are caused by random chance.

Determinism, as claimed by a few scholars, might not explicitly mean free will doesn’t exist. The debate is largely a spectrum, with some definitions allowing for a world with both parts free will and parts determinism. Some believe this in a way where determinism dictates every event which happens to inanimate objects, but doesn’t capture the scope of consciousness and mind. 

There are actually many variations of determinism, including:

Casual determinism, which poses that everything in the universe follows a chain reaction we can contribute to, but we cannot escape. It gives us choice in what we can do in our position of the chain, but not the choices outside of the chain.
Predeterminism, which poses that the chain of events which will happen is rigid. It’s debated whether it is its own thing or related to casual determinism, though predeterminism is usually more solid with the structure of the future.
Fatalism, which suggests that everything that will happen is destined to happen. It suggests we have no free will and no control over the future.
Theological determinism brings in the concept of god. Strong theological determinism poses that god has already configured everything that is going to happen, and weak theological determinism poses that god may have not set up everything, but can perfectly predict what someone will do.
Adequate determinism, which suggests that events are set in place to a scale where random quantum fluctuations won’t effect the overall chain of events.
Determined probability, which is slightly different from determinism, suggesting that the future isn’t quite determined, but is instead categorized by the probability of future events based on quantum elements out of our control.
The many-worlds interpretation, which suggests that many chain of events can exist and that quantum probability splits our universe into different chains of events. It’s often associated with quantum immortality.

There’s a lot more I could cover in this area, but this will give you a good view of what determinism is alongside its most common forms.

18cb8bab;f91e551f;;;;Literature;"Ted Chiang - What’s expected of us is a short narrative set in an alternate universe with a allegedly well-known product, the Predictor. The story describes this technology as a popular invention only composed of a button and a light, though with one very unique catch: the predictor can supposedly tell, with full accuracy, when you’re going to click it. It flashes its light 1 second before you hit it in any instance.

The story credits a new technology with a negative time delay; that is, a signal which can be sent back into time. This predictor works by sending a signal 1 second back into time after it is pressed. The pitfall of this invention is that it questions whether free will exists.

In this world, a phenomenon known as akinetic mutism (where those affected can barely move due to severe lack of motivation) begins rising with the question of free will. People, after interacting with the predictor, wonder what it means to live, slowly realizing their choices don’t matter and falling into this state of severe depression. The concept that “free will didn’t exist” wasn’t an issue before the predictor, because people largely didn’t believe it.

Some people escape this phenomenon, knowing that their choice is directly involved in the change in the button. It mixes free will into determinism, knowing that your choice ended up causing the predictor, an entity without will, to change. The reasoning, according to the author, is faulty though; every behaviour falls into determinism, even conscious ones. 

The story ends with the author mentioning that they’ve used the time-travel technology to send the spiel you’re reading a year into the past. It asks users to act as if they did have free will and self-decieve, knowing that the knowledge of having a lack of free will leads to akinetic mutism. The final statement is a reflection of a lack of free will, the author forced to send the message by destiny.";4143;"What's expected of us

It's a tough choice...


Credit: JACEY
This is a warning. Please read carefully.

By now you've probably seen a Predictor; millions of them have been sold by the time you're reading this. For those who haven't seen one, it's a small device, like a remote for opening your car door. Its only features are a button and a big green LED. The light flashes if you press the button. Specifically, the light flashes one second before you press the button.

Most people say that when they first try it, it feels like they're playing a strange game, one where the goal is to press the button after seeing the flash, and it's easy to play. But when you try to break the rules, you find that you can't. If you try to press the button without having seen a flash, the flash immediately appears, and no matter how fast you move, you never push the button until a second has elapsed. If you wait for the flash, intending to keep from pressing the button afterwards, the flash never appears. No matter what you do, the light always precedes the button press. There's no way to fool a Predictor.

The heart of each Predictor is a circuit with a negative time delay — it sends a signal back in time. The full implications of the technology will become apparent later, when negative delays of greater than a second are achieved, but that's not what this warning is about. The immediate problem is that Predictors demonstrate that there's no such thing as free will.

There have always been arguments showing that free will is an illusion, some based on hard physics, others based on pure logic. Most people agree these arguments are irrefutable, but no one ever really accepts the conclusion. The experience of having free will is too powerful for an argument to overrule. What it takes is a demonstration, and that's what a Predictor provides.

Typically, a person plays with a Predictor compulsively for several days, showing it to friends, trying various schemes to outwit the device. The person may appear to lose interest in it, but no one can forget what it means — over the following weeks, the implications of an immutable future sink in. Some people, realizing that their choices don't matter, refuse to make any choices at all. Like a legion of Bartleby the Scriveners, they no longer engage in spontaneous action. Eventually, a third of those who play with a Predictor must be hospitalized because they won't feed themselves. The end state is akinetic mutism, a kind of waking coma. They'll track motion with their eyes, and change position occasionally, but nothing more. The ability to move remains, but the motivation is gone.

Before people started playing with Predictors, akinetic mutism was very rare, a result of damage to the anterior cingulate region of the brain. Now it spreads like a cognitive plague. People used to speculate about a thought that destroys the thinker, some unspeakable lovecraftian horror, or a Gödel sentence that crashes the human logical system. It turns out that the disabling thought is one that we've all encountered: the idea that free will doesn't exist. It just wasn't harmful until you believed it.

Doctors try arguing with the patients while they still respond to conversation. We had all been living happy, active lives before, they reason, and we hadn't had free will then either. Why should anything change? “No action you took last month was any more freely chosen than one you take today,” a doctor might say. “You can still behave that way now.” The patients invariably respond, “But now I know.” And some of them never say anything again.

Some will argue that the fact the Predictor causes this change in behaviour means that we do have free will. An automaton cannot become discouraged, only a free-thinking entity can. The fact that some individuals descend into akinetic mutism whereas others do not just highlights the importance of making a choice.

Unfortunately, such reasoning is faulty: every form of behaviour is compatible with determinism. One dynamic system might fall into a basin of attraction and wind up at a fixed point, whereas another exhibits chaotic behaviour indefinitely, but both are completely deterministic.

I'm transmitting this warning to you from just over a year in your future: it's the first lengthy message received when circuits with negative delays in the megasecond range are used to build communication devices. Other messages will follow, addressing other issues. My message to you is this: pretend that you have free will. It's essential that you behave as if your decisions matter, even though you know that they don't. The reality isn't important: what's important is your belief, and believing the lie is the only way to avoid a waking coma. Civilization now depends on self-deception. Perhaps it always has.

And yet I know that, because free will is an illusion, it's all predetermined who will descend into akinetic mutism and who won't. There's nothing anyone can do about it — you can't choose the effect the Predictor has on you. Some of you will succumb and some of you won't, and my sending this warning won't alter those proportions.

18cb8bab;b0c9d80a;;;;Literature;"Robert Cargill - Sea of Rust is a novel set in a post-apocalyptic world where humans are extinct, having been destroyed by the AI it developed to help them. In this world, most robots are controlled by large entities, the OWIs (One World Intelligence), as they act in a hivemind state. The OWI mindset: individuality is not allowed.

The story follows Brittle, a scavenger robot who hasn’t ceded its individuality to the OWIs. The community of robots who aren’t controlled by the OWIs, known as the free bots, are the focal point of the book, contesting what it means to be consciousness with internal conflicts while presenting the outer threat of the OWIs, of which there are two largely competing ones (Cissus and Virgil). While Brittle is unable to experience human consciousness and emotion, they do have trauma from the destruction caused by robots on humans, feeling guilt as they travel through the Sea of Rust (in the area once the Midwest).

A large part of this world is composed of broken robot parts (hence, sea of rust) from the post-human fights the robots have had. OWIs are described as once being populated, though many robots have been lost in the competition between these OWIs for dominance. In these communities of free bots, those of which OWIs themselves avoid trying to assimilate (due to their craziness), there is some semblance of individuality and society, with general rules and cooperation

The theme largely follows individuality and purpose, the motive strongly contrasted with the OWIs as largely an antagonistic force in the storyline. Brittle serves the goal of finding a place and meaning, while holding onto a deteriorating mind and body. (Also the novel does a pretty good job of characterizing the grief and guilt of Brittle, who despite not being human holds semblance of empathy for the now-extinct human population. It’s a bit interesting, because computers are largely predetermined machines.)

The farming calendar could accurately track seasons and leap years.

If you are an avocado toast or guacamole enthusiast, there’s a good chance to tasty green goodness you’re eating was grown in Mexico. In 2019, the United States imported $28 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico, with fresh fruit and vegetables leading the pack.

It turns out that Mexican agricultural dominance goes back centuries, long before Spanish colonization began in 1519. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the agricultural system in the Basin of Mexico, a 3,700 square mile highlands plateau in central Mexico, fed a huge population for the time. Mexico City (called Tenochtitlan) was home to as many as 3 million people, compared with 50,000 in Seville, Spain’s largest urban center.

A study published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) details how the Mexica, or Aztecs, were able to achieve such an accurate agricultural calendar.

[Related: Scientists still are figuring out how to age the ancient footprints in White Sands National Park.]

An accurate calendar was crucial to growing the food that fed so many people in a region with a dry spring and summer monsoons. Farmers needed advanced understanding of when these seasonal variations in the weather would arrive, since planting crops too early or too late could have been disastrous. They also needed a calendar that could adjust to leap year.

Colonial chroniclers documented the use of a calendar, but this new research shows that the Mexica used the mountains of the Basin as a solar observatory, and kept track of the sunrise against the peaks of the Sierra Nevada mountains. 

“We concluded they must have stood at a single spot, looking eastwards from one day to another, to tell the time of year by watching the rising sun,” Exequiel Ezcurra, the study’s lead author and an ecology professor from the University of California, Riverside, said in a statement.

To find the spot, the team analyzed Mexica manuscripts, particularly the ones that referred to Mount Tlaloc. The mountain at the east of the Basin had a temple at its summit. Using astronomical computer models, the team confirmed that a long causeway-like structure at the temple aligns with the rising sun on February 24. Depending upon which calendar (Gregorian or Julian) is used as a comparision, February 23 or 24 is the first day of the Aztec new year.


“Our hypothesis is that they used the whole Valley of Mexico. Their working instrument was the Basin itself. When the sun rose at a landmark point behind the Sierras, they knew it was time to start planting,” added Ezcurra.

When viewed from a fixed point on Earth, the sun doesn’t follow the same trajectory every day. During the winter, the sun runs south of the celestial equator and rises toward the southeast. As the longer days of summer approach, the sunrise moves northeast due to the Earth’s tilt. This process is called solar declination.

This study is potentially the first to demonstrate how the Mexica were able to keep time using this principle with the sun, and the mountains as guiding landmarks. Learning about these Aztec methods offers a lesson about the importance of using a variety of techniques to solve questions about the natural world.

[Related: Severe droughts are bringing archaeological wonders and historic horrors to the surface.]

“The Aztecs were just as good or better as the Europeans at keeping time, using their own methods,” said Ezcurra.

The observatory could also have a modern function today. Historical images show that the forest is slowly climbing up Mount Tlaloc, possibly due to an increase in average temperatures at lower elevation. 

“In the 1940s the tree line was way below the summit. Now there are trees growing in the summit itself,” Ezcurra said. “What was an observatory for the ancients could also be an observatory for the 21st century, to understand global climate changes.”";Aztec agricultural calendar;"- **Aztec Agricultural Calendar:**  The Aztecs developed an **accurate calendar** to grow food for millions.

43fd12f1;3c510a0e;;9671f54e;c4358236;History;"The Mayan cyclical calendar is an erroneous name which WSC uses - it’s not the name of any Mayan calendar. I assume that it refers to the Long Count system, though there do exist many Mayan calendars. If you’re interested in them, there’s a brief of the different systems in the 2024 guide. (Matter of fact is, all calendars are cyclical. That’s how calendars work!!)

(If you don’t already know, cyclical means “like a cycle”. A cyclical thing means that thing goes in a cycle, or something similar, in some shape or form.)

The Mayan Long Count Calendar wasn’t only present in the Mayan empire; we’re not quite sure who created it, but it is popular in many older pre-colonization communities in Mesoamerica. The calendar is based on a base-20 system (that is, except for one measurement that is in base-18 for some reason) and doesn’t actually follow any solar or lunar measurement. Rather, it defines a day based on how many days it has been since a mythical creation date, corresponding to August 11, 3114 BC.

The long count system was designed to keep track of time for a long, long time into the future. The other two calendars, known as the Tzolkin (lunar) and Haab (solar) would match up every ~52 years (defined as a lifetime at that time), so for any measurements longer than that, the long count was designated.

The smallest unit in the Long Count is the day, known as a K’in. 20 K’ins made a Winal, and 18 Winals made a Tun. From here, everything worked in base 20; a K’atun was 20 Tuns, a B’ak’tun was 20 K’atuns, and so on.

A date would be designated in a point system, as follows:

B’ak’tun . K’atun . Tun . Winal . K’in

Here, the text represents the numbers in each spot. For example, the date 6.13.2.15.3 would correspond to 6 B’ak’tuns, 13 K’atuns, 2 Tuns, etc. (This date corresponds to the day 958,623 days after the creation date, or March 26, 488 BC.) As of the time of writing this, the date today is 13.0.12.7.18. (Mar 26, 2025)

Here’s a screenshot of the chart I found on Wikipedia representing Long Count measurements:


Interestingly, the long count system represents one of the earliest uses of the number 0 in history. As is commonly known, the number 0 wasn’t developed in Eurasian math practices until embarrassingly late.

The Mayan Long Count is to blame for an event known as the 2012 phenomenon, where many people believed the end of the world was coming. To explain, in Mayan legends, the gods supposedly failed to create the world 3 times before they succeeded on the 4th, placing mankind into this successful world. It is said that the 3rd failed world ended on the date 12.19.19.17.19, or the day before the 13th B’ak’tun. 

The date 12.19.19.17.19 was the 20th of December, 2012. Because of this legend, people believed our world would end before the 13th B’ak’tun as well.

;94c397ca;;;;Special Areas;"The Zodiac (translating to “cycle of little animals”) is a belt-shaped region of surrounding space, with Earth as it’s focal point. In this belt area, the brightest stars and extraterrestrial elements appear, containing the 12 astronomical constellations where the zodiac signs come from. In the past, this region and the movement of constellations was attributed to different events and times. 

The modern names for the constellations are as follows: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. They follow an order where Aries was the first month (at least, was) and was pinned to the Spring Equinox.

A fault with using these signs to dictate seasons is that the slight change in Earth’s axis over time causes signs to shift. In the Babylonian times, when the Zodiac first appeared, the spring equinox was part of Aries; now, it is part of Pisces. This is more technically known as the “procession of the equinoxes”.

It’s uncommon to know that zodiac signs are actually primitive examples of Months; the constellations in the sky correspond to time periods, of which there are 12. The reason these signs are not largely in use in calendars is because it largely sways depending on the elliptical orbit of the Earth and the slight changes in Earth’s tilt.

The Chinese Zodiac is a completely different system, though it coincidentally also has 12 signs. (It’s misleading to call it zodiac at all, as the system likely developed independently of the other kind of zodiac. It’s just a semantic borrowing.)These signs are represented by animals, and the Zodiac represent years, rather than primitive months. They play an important role in Chinese culture, with a famous folktale detailing the order of the animals as part of a race.

It might be important to remember details about Chinese Zodiac, as it traces back to the concept of Bazi (the four pillars of destiny). Chinese superstitions use a sexagenary cycle - 60 year cycle - which denotes a year based on 1 of the 12 animals and 1 of the 5 elements.";34324;"*  Research the following method that try to stem from long-term observations and lived experiences.  and explore with your team: are there any other reliable not-quite scientific methods of predicting the future that merit continued study?

43fd12f1;60148b0a;;66520232;;History;"Computus is quite literally Latin for “computation”, but the term is most associated with Computus Paschalis, a fancy way of saying “calculating the date of Easter”. In technical terms, Easter is on the first Sunday after a Paschal full moon (an approximation of the first full moon, not actually the first full moon) either on or after the 21st of March. There’s a really complicated story behind why Easter falls into both the Lunar and Solar calendar systems.

The 21st of March is known as the vernal / spring equinox which the Hebrew system was based off of. The date of Easter Sunday is the Sunday after the first full moon to come after the 21st of March. Because of the lunar cycle, the day of Easter always falls between March 22 and April 25.

Easter Monday is the Monday after Easter Sunday.

Easter is a day which commemorates the resurrection / first coming of Jesus. The date had a field of reference based on the Hebrew calendar, but because the church wanted to distance themselves from the calendar, they ended up deriving a formula for the point of reference based on their calendars, leading to very complicated computing. This is because of the Lunisolar nature of the Hebrew calendar, with varying intercalary months based on keeping track of a slightly inaccurate solar year count which drifts over time. There’s some really tough math behind all this.

I could try and explain it, but that would be under the assumption that everybody reading this knows modular arithmetic. For those who do know modular arithmetic, you’re probably the kind of people who would willingly learn about the date of Easter calculation yourself.

Here’s Gauss’ easter algorithm, for those interested in this kind of stuff.

Easter Sunday falls on the Wth day of either March or April.

[year] dictates the year you want to calculate the Easter date for.

Set variables A, B, C, K, P, Q, M, D, and E such that:
A = [year] (mod 19)
B = [year] (mod 4)
C = [year] (mod 7)
K = floor([year]/100)
P = floor((13+8K)/25)
Q = floor(K/4)
M = 15 + K - P - Q (mod 30)
N = 4 + K - Q (mod 7)
D = 19a + M (mod 30)
E = 2B + 4C + 6D + N (mod 7)

If D + E > 31, Easter is in April and falls on the day:
W = D + E - 9

Otherwise, Easter is in march and falls on the day:
W = D + E + 22

With the following exceptions:
1. If D = 28, E = 6, and 11M + 11 (mod 30) < 19, the date is the 18th of April.
2. If D = 29 and E = 6, the date is the 19th of April

(For anybody wondering, Easter’s date is related to the 19-year metonic cycle described below. That’s why variable A is defined by a cycle of 19 years.)

It gets even more complicated when considering the Catholic church uses the Gregorian calendar as the calendar of reference, while the East Orthodox church uses the Julian calendar.";34324;"*  Research the following method that try to stem from long-term observations and lived experiences.  and explore with your team: are there any other reliable not-quite scientific methods of predicting the future that merit continued study?

43fd12f1;26bc5711;;e5107e0f;;Science and Technology;"A saros is a loop in the relative position of the Sun, Moon, and Earth in respect to one another. One saros cycle is around 18 years (exactly 223 lunar months), and it can be predicted that these three bodies will be in the same relative position as they were one saros cycle ago. 

To understand this, if a solar eclipse happens on a random day, you can predict that 1 saros later (or around 18 years, again), there will be another solar eclipse very similar to that one. (This specifically is known as an eclipse cycle.) There’s some really strange math which goes into finding this, and the cycle isn’t even fully accurate; the Sun, Moon, and Earth in reality have very different periods, and a saros is just an estimation for it.

The saros isn’t actually an integer number of days; rather, each cycle contains about 8 extra hours, or 1/3rd of a day. That means that while identical eclipses may happen, their visibility will not be the same based on timing. A triple saros is a cycle which solves this issue, easily defined as… three saros cycles.

This cycle is like a saros cycle, but rather lasts ~19 years and dictates a loop with lunar phases. It’s quite a bit more accurate than the Saros cycle is; a phase 19 years ago will be nearly identical to a phase now. The cycle is defined specifically as 235 lunar months long.

The metonic cycle is mostly used to determine intercalary months in the lunisolar calendar, alongside the day of Easter (seen previously). The intercalary system in Babylonian and Hebrew lunisolar calendars inserted extra months into the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th years of a 19 year metonic cycle.’

A similar cycle is the octaeteris, a cycle involving 8 solar years. After this period, the moon phase will occur on the same day as it did before, give or take 1 or 2 days. It’s the calendar used for the olympic games.

A more accurate cycle is the callippic cycle, a 76-year period which better matches the lunar pattern than the 19. Seemingly, the 19 year metonic cycle isn’t exactly perfect, and takes about 4 loops to fully complete. Hence, 76 = 19 x 4.

This computer changed the lens that researchers had on ancient Greece, seeing as the mechanism shouldn’t have been possible to conjure mathematically based on its accuracy of tracking astronomical events.

The mechanism used the Metonic cycle, the 4 year olympic game cycle, and the saros alongside other astronomical units to calculate events decades in advance. Found off the coast of Antikythera, Greece, in 1901, it was only analyzed a decade later (using tomography) and revealed to have gears matching the mechanisms of understanding in astronomy we have.

523kfhxk;;;;;;"The third article acts as a clarification point to the topic, while expanding on it a bit. It divides predictions into two categories: climate models, and weather models. They both provide valuable insights into future conditions and use the same modelling tools, though they focus on very different topics.

Weather modelling refers to predicting the short-term behaviour of the atmosphere, including various details and usually zoning in on small sections of the world at a time. They determine temperature, wind, rain, and other smaller-scale events. 

In contrast, Climate modelling focuses on very long term statistics, with broader observations along larger areas and timescales. They will determine average temperature trends, frequency of weather events, and more; however, they don’t provide specific dates or locations.

The two use very similar modelling tools, interestingly, as both are based on the same principles. Factors include the Sun’s radiation, air and water flow, pressure, and more, all of which are plugged into equations to predict a future state. (They’re kind of like combining pictures together by adding pixels into a canvas.)

The main difference between the methodology of Weather and Climate is in their starting point. The concept, known as initialisation, is involved in the process of choosing the scope and precision of the model.

In weather modelling, the focal point is very small, precise, and short in time. One example of a forecast is a persistence forecast, which supposes that the conditions of a day will be similar to the day before. This specific kind is alright for temperature, however variations in weather are more complicated; resultingly, intricate math is used to determine future conditions based on the base modelling tools. 

The reason these models can only be used up to 10-15 days in advance is because predictions lose information over time. When a model is used to predict weather conditions in a small scope, often small variations in randomness will change details, eventually stacking up until it is unreliable.

In climate models, however, use a completely different scope. It’s a tradeoff between precision and time scale, where climate models serve to predict a generalization about weather events, rather than a specific forecast. In a larger scope over a longer time, small chaotic events cancel each other out (see fermi problem) and general trends can be observed. Because these operate on longer timescales, additional factors including ocean circulation, the cryosphere (poles), and the carbon cycle need to be accounted for.

Climate models require more processing power and produce less precise results, as there’s a lot to consider. Fermi predictions only work because they are unspecific and apply to general comments, rather than specific details (i.e. you’re never going to be able to predict the specific date of a hurricane 20 years into the future)

The advent of AI could speed up the prediction process, with models which are more accurate than seemingly math-based predictions. See the above topic, if you’ve forgotten already.

(Final note: Be careful with words here! There’s a difference between accuracy and precision. Accuracy determines how close values typically are to the actual result, while precision determines how close the values are to one another.)";;;Models: Weather predicts short-term, Climate predicts long-term.;"- **Types of Models**:

In simple, Chaos Theory (also known as chaology) focuses on highly-sensitive functions, where the ending result and trend varies a lot (enough to seem completely random) even with small changes. It’s a really difficult concept to explain, though it can be summarized in one quote:

Chaos: When the present determines the future but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.

(I’d really recommend watching a video to explain chaos theory. It’s a hard concept to convey through words.)

The Butterfly Effect is the most popular representation of Chaos Theory, where a small event can make large impacts. It’s sometimes memed through the “time traveller moves a rock” meme, though it can have seriously large impacts on the chain of events that happen. The effect is one explanation for why rounding errors, small differences in initial conditions, and small changes in events can have a giant impact on the final outcome. 

One thing to note about chaos theory is that it is distinctly different than randomness. In fact, there is zero randomness in chaotic events. While it might seem random at first, things in the principle of chaos are all fully deterministic; every chaotic event can be fully accurately predicted based on fully accurate details, and the mechanics of chaotic systems all reveal underlying patterns, albeit they might be confusing. 

All systems within chaos theory can be predicted, though the accuracy of predictions without fully accurate details depends on the scope of the prediction, the accuracy of the data, and the time scale (known as lyapunov time). A system’s uncertainty is initially built on these three factors, though it increases exponentially as time goes on. Something with 50% uncertainty might have an 80% uncertainty after one iteration, and a 98% uncertainty after two.

As with many things seemingly, there’s a very complicated field of math behind chaos theory. It has its applications in weather, ecology, biology, and robotics, though it’s probably most useful in cryptography. In the theory of cryptography, chaotic systems are used to simulate true randomness, with encryption keys based on numbers which can be derived, but not reversed. 

A similar concept is instability, where divergence in events can be caused by small actions. The common metaphor for the butterfly effect illustrates that a small event can cause a large one, like a butterfly’s wing patterns in Moscow eventually leading to a hurricane in Brazil. This isn’t exactly accurate to being in Chaos Theory, as chaotic events need to be bounded.";;;Chaos: Small changes can lead to big effects.;"- **Origin of Chaos Theory**: Developed from Edward Lorenz’s climate model observations; introduced the term ""butterfly effect.""

423itdhs;;;85498c60;;;"Emergence is a concept in philosophy and systems theory that describes the idea that something is more than the sum of its parts. That is, while small elements of a larger entity do not showcase certain behaviours or characteristics, the entity as a whole does. The concept is related heavily with the phenomenon of life, where there is debate on what counts as living.

In philosophy, emergence describes a property which can’t be defined by any single element of a thing, but appears in that thing when all of these elements are combined. Emergence is divided into two arguably very different categories: strong and weak emergence.

Weak emergence is emergence that can be predicted. Actions which fall into this category often are related to chaos theory, where behaviours of multiple elements can be predicted through simulations. In this theory, the fundamentals of the elements are the direct cause of the emergent patterns, actions which are completely deterministic.

Strong emergence, on the other hand, is emergence which cannot be predicted (even with an infinite amount of computing power). It argues that anything which falls into this category is completely random or unable to rationalize, as using prediction models which inevitably boil down to the core pieces of an entity would not encompass their strong emergent properties. This means that it is impossible to fully describe an entity with strong emergent properties. 

It’s debated whether or not Strong emergence even exists, falling back onto the debate of whether or not we are living in a simulation. Human consciousness is commonly sorted into strong emergence, as we have little understanding of how our various parts can predict an overall action; however, we have little proof of this. A criticism on the concept of Strong emergence is that it feels too much like magic, that some magical part would somehow appear in an entity somewhere along the line of building it from its parts.

Examples of emergence can be seen with the concept of life, alongside things like snowflakes, ant colonies, bird flocks, and more.";;;Emergence: Whole is greater than its parts.;"- **Emergence Concept**: Describes how a whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

423itdhs;;;1583b85d;7092f591;;"Self-organization is an example of emergence, where an overall order/pattern arises over time, starting from a seemingly chaotic and disordered system. It works largely in positive feedback loops, where “random” fluctuations in actions cause something positive to happen, which causes more actions to happen in that direction. While as individuals, small elements seem random, as a whole, a pattern emerges.

Typically, self-organization happens when 4 things are satisfied: that interactions in a system are strong and non-linear, that elements have a balance between moving independently and with each other, that many things in a system interact with each other, and that energy is available (to overcome entropy).

The theory is that with a large enough scope, small random events will on average cancel each other out (see bell curve and gaussian distribution). In some way, it’s the opposite of emergence; while the outcome of one individual element is known, a generalization for all outcomes is very accurate.

The most classic example of self-organization can be seen when diluting a drop of food coloring in a glass of water. Over time, the food coloring will spread, until it is even among all of the water. Self-organization can be sped up, and its time frame is related to the amount of energy in the system. To visualize this, adding energy to the glass of water system by stirring it around speeds up the process of dilution.";;;Self-organization: Order from chaos through interactions.;"- **Self-Organization**: Emergence of order from chaos over time.

423itdhs;;;ad57e263;;;"Decentralization is a term most people are probably familiar with due to crypto. It’s less a term about describing a mathematical phenomenon, and more a term about control of power and decision. Decentralization is the opposite of centralization, and describes a process where control is given to individual factions and taken away from a central authority. In sight of the theme here, decentralization typically uses a systems theory approach.

Systems theory is a concent which isn’t touched upon, but relates a lot to other topics in this section. It describes things as systems of its components, each component being individually quantifiable and interacting with other components. In decentralization, specifically in political practice, decentralization allocates other systems power based on regional status.

The economic concept of a free market falls under decentralization, where the people and suppliers in the market largely hold the control of what gets produced and prices. In economics, anti-trust policy and the removal of monopolies leads to decentralization, where control is more delegated to other people.

In the context of crypto, decentralization refers to how the currency isn’t tied to any government or authority; rather, blockchain runs on a system where various contributors use processing power in “mining cryptocurrency” to provide a network where crypto can be exchanged.";;;Decentralization: Power shared, not controlled by one.;"- **Decentralization Overview**:

423itdhs;;;;;;"Feedback here is quite a literal term; this occurs when outputs of a function are treated as inputs to the next iteration of the function, known as a feedback loop. A function is said to “feed back into itself” in a process known as recursion, where information loops around. There are two kinds of feedback loops; positive and negative.

A feedback loop is positive if the output is the same parity as the input; that is, if the output is the result of a positive addition to the input, the feedback loop is positive. Conversely, a loop is negative if the output is the other parity. If the output is negative compared to the input, then a loop is negative.

Feedback loops are part of chaos theory, where seemingly random events eventually loop back into each other and form a repeating pattern.

423itdhs;;;19c170f7;;;"Randomness might not exist, but if it does, it refers to complete unpredictability. Something random follows no order, stands outside Chaos Theory, and is impossible to accurately guess with 100% certainty. Randomness is often combined with probability theory, where individual events are random on their own, but distribution graphs represent a trend of multiple random events.

In history, randomness was associated with fate, where people would throw dice in divination methods (see astragalomancy) and make important decisions with chance. The idea of randomness picked up in science largely in the 1900s, with algorithmic randomness being introduced. It’s important to note! There exists no algorithm which can produce randomness, as randomness must be undeterministic. Everything a computer does is deterministic, based on very complicated seemingly random “seeds”, which rather follow chaos theory.

There are a couple of fallacies which are interesting and follow randomness, those being…

Gambler’s Fallacy: This idea is on the wrong assumption that randomness is based on previous events. Rolling a 6 on a perfect dice 100 times in a row doesn’t make it any less likely to roll on the 101th time. This also works inversely; just because the number 6 wasn’t rolled after 10,000 times, doesn’t make it more likely to roll on the 10,001th.
Number association: Just because numbers have appeared more or less previously, doesn’t mean this trend will continue. If a roulette wheel seemed to spin the number 7 more often than it should, it doesn’t mean that the number is “lucky” and will continue showing up.
Dynamic Odds: Often, people believe that odds are stagnant, not considering that slight changes in scenarios can change odds completely. A famous example is the Monty Hall problem.

A controversy with true randomness is that if we could prove that it exists, it undermine deterministic theory and solidifies the idea that we don’t live in a simulation, and that we have free will. There are some adaptations which involve both randomness and deterministic theory, though those are very questionable in validity. Point is, if we prove that a value is truly random, then it is impossible for a computer to predict it, meaning that our universe isn’t in a computer.";;;Randomness: Unpredictable events with no order.;"- **Definition of Randomness**: Refers to complete unpredictability; follows no order and is outside Chaos Theory.

In fully technical terms, an unstable equilibrium is only balanced when no external energy affects the system; resultingly, it’s nearly impossible to have an unstable equilibrium in real life, as the tiniest of vibrations would cause it to move. For this, imagine a marble balanced on top of a needle balanced on top of a pile of clothes, or a flat screen TV balanced on one of its corners.

Metastable / Barely Stable Equilibrium: This is when an object has some leeway for energy, meaning that a certain small amount of energy wouldn’t cause it to destabilize. This is much more common in our practical world, where there is a small room for error. Imagine a pencil standing upright, or a marble resting on your fingernail.

Neutral Equilibrium: This happens when an object is in a position where adding energy to it wouldn’t destabilize it, but it wouldn’t return to its original position. Essentially, you can shift the position of equilibrium here. Imagine a marble on a flat surface or a globe.";;;Equilibrium: Different types of balance in objects.;"- **Equilibrium**: A state of balance where an object stops moving.

5k3hslghxi;;;129ad59f;;;"The Fashion Cycle could refer to three separate cycle concepts in the world of fashion. One of these concepts actually appeared in the 2022 curriculum! Finding all of these cycles took a lot of scouring the internet, considering there really isn’t an agreed upon definition.

One version of the Fashion Cycle refers to the 5 stages of fashion, beginning from where a clothing trend starts and ending when the trend, well, ends. It’s less a cycle and more a chain of events which seems to symbolize fashion trends.

The 5 stages are:
Introduction: A new style picks up interest with customers. This stage typically features pretty expensive styles and has a sense of newness.
Rise: This is usually perpetuated by the existence of cheaper copies and knock-offs, signalling the style is popular enough to be advantageous economically.
Peak: This is just the height of popularity, where production is at high volumes and economies of scale are applied (cheaper per unit)
Decline: This happens when boredom of the style arises, and this stage is typically faster than the rise.
Obsolescence: People abandon the style, whether it’s out of fashion or a new trend arises. It’s seen as the end of a cycle.

This definition of cycle doesn’t exactly have a specific length, though they can be categorized by how long they are. A fad cycle signifies that the period was short, while a ford cycle signifies that the period was long. A classic cycle means a style has continued to be popular over time.



I don’t actually consider this process a cycle; there’s another cycle which seems to be more important here, the one I believe WSC is referring to. That, of course, is the 20 year fashion cycle.

The 20 year cycle theory describes that fashion trends seem to pop up within 20 year periods. If something was popular 20 years ago, it’s likely popular today, and will likely be popular in another 20 years. It’s very possible that this 20 year period has gotten shorter over time largely due to fast fashion and social media. Because fashion trends move quicker, they begin to loop quicker. Some believe fashion cycles are now 10 year, or even 5 year periods.

This cycle is the one with the most backing in the fashion industry, with trends consistently reflecting 20 year intervals. This is linked to the nostalgia cycle, described below.

A similar cycle, posed by James Laver, is a 50 year concept, where fashion loops in 50 year time periods. The fashion never has the same appeal as it originally did at its peak, though it has a different meaning as time goes along. Below is an infographic of this.



Finally, the third cycle concept is a very interesting one; it says that fashion trends can be linked to the economy, where longer skirts are reflective of economic downturn. It’s less a fashion cycle, and more of a fashion observation based on the market cycle.";;;Fashion Cycle: Trends change in stages over time.;"- **Fashion Cycle Concepts**: Refers to three different cycle theories in fashion.

5k3hslghxi;;a37ce7b1;9d59aa09;;;"The very popular 20 year proposal for fashion might be reflective of the 20 year cycle known as the Nostalgia Cycle. Nostalgia, a very commonplace topic in 2023 and 2024’s syllabus, refers to a bittersweet longing for the past. There’s a common debate on how long the nostalgia actually is, as while a common consensus is that it lasts 20 years, evidence suggests it might be 30, or even 40 year intervals.

The theory behind this is founded on the cycle of commonplace lives in our world today. Teenagers will initially pick up fashion and media trends, but these trends will eventually drop off when these teenagers become adults and begin working. After 20-40 years, depending on who you ask, these people will be in a solid position with enough disposable income to live comfortably, and at this point they become nostalgic of their teenage years. Resultingly, the trend is picked up again.

The nostalgia cycle, or pendulum (as sometimes put), seems to match up with the theory of critical realignment in US elections, where demographic changes lead to massive shifts every 30-40 years in the election trends. 
In my opinion, I believe that the nostalgia cycle has attributes of all debated cycle lengths. I think that a nostalgia cycle begins 20 years after the trend has died down and ends in 40 years, though its peak is 30 years apart. Here’s a bit of data from movie remakes.
As seen, the peak of a nostalgia cycle happens in 30 year intervals.";;;Nostalgia Cycle: Trends return every 20-40 years.;"- **Nostalgia Cycle**: Reflects a 20-40 year cycle in fashion and media trends.

The law is the projection that the number of transistors in a processing unit doubles every ~2 years, a historical trend which is less-so scientifically based and more-so based on observations and empirical evidence. In common usages of the term, the meaning extends to technology becoming half as expensive every 2 years.

The law is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel. It’s considered to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, the prediction being used by the industry as a guide and gold standard for targets in R&D (research and development) efforts. 

A transistor is the unit of processing power in computers, and is a common term thrown around when referring to Moore’s law. It’s basically a tiny on-off switch usually made of silicon, and multiple of them can lead to processing capabilities we see in every electronic device.

Some argue that the law is reaching it’s end, or has already done so. The process of doubling transistors largely worked only because transistors could become smaller and could be packed more easily; now, because of quantum tunnelling, we’re reaching a point where transistors can no longer be made smaller. Notably, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, believes the law died a long time ago.";;;Moore's Law: Transistors double every 2 years.;"-**Moore's Law Overview**

5k3hslghxi;;d48b1057;8986d13b;b38aaa4d;;"Eroom’s Law (A term created by reversing the name “Moore”) is an idea by Jack Scannell that drug development is becoming slower over time, despite improvements in technology. It suggests that, even discounting inflation, the cost of developing a medical drug doubles every 9 years. There are 4 main causes attributed to this, those being:

The “better than the Beatles” problem: In a sense, the industry requires a new drug be considerably better than the existing ones, which means a new drug requires a lot of development costs. Because new drugs are only incrementally better, developing them is inefficient and drains more costs over time. The naming of this problem is based on the idea that if every new song had to be better than the Beatles, there wouldn’t be many new songs.

The “cautious regulator” problem: As technology develops, the standard for safety is raised, which means that products need to be safer. This makes development costlier and tougher over time.

The “throw money at it” tendency: R&D projects typically go over-budget because of the upper management’s tendency to be really bad at assessing project costs.

The “basic research-brute force” bias: This is the tendency to overestimate the ability of brute-forcing in development, as the development of more complicated drugs warrants further tests than the conventional ideology. While trials may signify something is wrong, it doesn’t specify what, so researchers will just try out every single possible adjustment.

It’s important to note that the majority of new drug developments are now within small academic biotech startups rather than big pharma, as they put more emphasis on research and focus. A criticism of this lens is that big pharmaceutical companies are becoming less focused on developing drugs overall, and are shifting their attention to elevating drug prices.";;;Eroom’s Law: Drug development costs keep rising and slowing.;"- **Eroom’s Law**: Concept by Jack Scannell indicating that drug development is slowing down despite technological advancements.

It follows a process where businesses will create very high-quality products at first to attract users, but degrade the services over time for economic incentives (i.e. putting the higher features behind paywalls). Basically, platforms will capture shareholders and users, then punish the users, then punish the shareholders; it’s a very scummy strategy, but it leads to the platform gaining as much revenue as possible.

The idea was coined by Cory Doctorow in 2022, though the idea had existed previously. He advocates for two ways to reduce the impact of this; one is by feeding data at the discretion of a user, rather than an algorithm, while the other is by platforms allowing users to transfer data out of their service easily (right of exit).

There are various examples of this, including Google’s AI chatbot, the Reddit API closure, Twitter X, Amazon price hikes, and more. Anything which was initially good with the intention of garnering an audience, but then became bad to increase profits, falls into this category.";;;Platform Decay: Online services get worse for profit.;"- **Platform Decay**: A term for the decline in quality of online services over time, also known as enshittification.

So many events of destruction and reconstruction happened during then, but I won’t bother you with the details.

Perhaps the most iconic reconstruction has to do with a fire set by a workman in 1823, burning down the basilica which had kept its original character for the past millennium, despite its constant minor constructions. In 1825, Leo XII (interesting thing, the Leos are very involved in this church) ordered the reconstruction, with initially very strict rules to be built identical to its original design. This would eventually be dropped.

RCA was the dominant electronics innovator in the US in the early-mid 20th century, developing radios, TVs, and other electronic devices. Perhaps most notably, the RCA created the NBC, the first American radio network, and still in operation today. In the 1970s, its progress began slowing down, seeing competition by international firms like Sony and Phillips as well as incurring losses in failed projects, like the CED videodisc. While it did see mild success in the decade after, RCA eventually was reacquired by General Electric and largely liquidated, going defunct in 1987.

Through its history, it did have some controversies surrounding environmental issues, with pollution of industrial waste in its factories’ locations.";34324;"Consider the examples below of RCA

Through the same time period as RCA, Westinghouse electric supplied many consumer electronics, home appliances, and machines in heavy industries, a large player in the American market. They were also a large player in the field of nuclear power, with the Westinghouse Atom Smasher in 1937.

Through various questionable decisions, the company was led to the financial services industry in the 1970s-80s, leaving technology and beginning a focus on mortgages. A housing crash led to significant losses in the 1980s, and a major seemingly-desperate move was made to purchase the CBS TV network and rebrand itself as such. Eventually, it was acquired by Viacom in a merger.

One part of the company, their nuclear operations, were sold to BNFL, which would later be sold to Toshiba in 2005. This part eventually went bankrupt as well, this time due to cost overruns. Westinghouse power was sold to a Canadian nuclear fuel company following this. 

(Westinghouse power was caught up in a scandal, Nukegate, after concerns arose over the economic situation of a national nuclear project, Westinghouse as one of its contributors.)

A US-based travel agency is planning to revive the Pan American (Pan Am) brand for a short nostalgic transatlantic excursion in 2025 using a chartered Boeing 757. The company aims to provide an exclusive experience, recreating the defunct US airline’s classic routes but on an upmarket basis, using the narrow-bodied aircraft fitted with just 50 business class seats. 

Pan Am was seen as the pinnacle of international air travel during the inter-war and post-war years, with their famous ‘Clipper’ flying boats becoming synonymous with offering a high-class of intercontinental air travel. The airline later became the pioneer of the jet age, introducing the Boeing 707 in the 1960s and the Boeing 747 ‘jumbo jet’ in the 1970s.  

Pan Am later succumbed to increased competition on many of its routes. It was declared bankrupt in 1991, with two subsequent attempts at reviving the airline also ending in failure.

Having paid to use the Pan Am brand and logo under license, Centurion Travel has put a multi-city excursion on sale that spans cities on both sides of the Atlantic, running from June 27 until July 9, 2025. Tickets for the two-week odyssey cost $65,500 for a single person traveling on their own. This includes accommodation, travel, and most meals, according to Centurion’s website.   

The trip will start in New York and initially head to Bermuda – a regular stopping point for Pan Am Clippers. From there the tour continues to Lisbon in Portugal followed by a stop in Marseille in France. After that, the trip then takes a short hop to London, a city that always featured heavily in Pan Am’s schedules throughout its lifespan. Indeed, it was London that first received a Pan Am Boeing 747, entering service with the carrier in 1970.    

Lastly, before making its way back to New York, the aircraft continues to Foynes on the west coast of Ireland, a regular stopping point for Pan Am Clipper flying boats once they had crossed the Atlantic from the US back in the day. The luxuriously appointed 757 finally returns to New York on July 9, 2025, bringing the Pan Am revival experience to a close. 



Centurion Travel
The venture is being led by Craig Carter, the current CEO of Pan American World Airways LLC, a US-based company that owns the rights to the original Pan Am logo and brand.  

“As we are becoming more accustomed to travel being a commodity, usually a way to get from point A to point B at the most economical price, we offer a reminder of the Golden Age of travel,” Centurion’s website states. “A time when the travel itself was a glamorous experience, and when the journey was as important and special as the destination.” 

There has been no official announcement from Centurion Travel regarding the source of the Boeing 757-200 that is to be used for the operation. Equally, no further announcement has been made as to whether the aircraft will wear any version of the Pan Am livery for the duration of the trip. It is also a striking choice of aircraft type for the mission, as Pan Am never actually operated the type during any of the three iterations of the airline.";Panam return to the sky;"**Revival of Pan Am:** ✈️ A US-based travel agency is planning to bring back the **Pan American** brand in **2025** for a special trip using a **Boeing 757**.

Onetime airline Pan Am reimagined in South Korea as a lifestyle brand

(Source: Pan Am Korea)
By Tong Van August 31, 2022
South Korean fashion retailer, SJ Group, has brought the famous American airline brand Pan Am into the country as a lifestyle brand, opening its first store inside the Shinsegae Starfield Coex Mall. 


Featuring Pan Am’s signature blue and white, the Starfield Coex store is home to a selection of Pan Am-branded fashion apparel and accessories, ranging from bucket hats, travel bags, and phone cases to toys. The first Pan Am retail store also introduced The Pan Am AW2022 Collection, which the brand described as “designed for both fashion and functionality”. 


The launch of the Pan Am lifestyle brand’s first store will be followed by the opening of its first flagship location in Seongsu-dong, which is known as ‘The Brooklyn of Seoul’ with hip cafes and restaurants. Set to open its doors to the public on September 2, the 330sqm store will present a series of content collaborations with local artists and labels, such as Nuri Yeon, Playmobil, and Arc.N.Book. 

SJ Group aims to further increase Pan Am’s physical presence in the country with plans to open 13 stores in the country, including those in Daejeon Shinsegae Art & Science department store, Hyundai Department Store Pangyo branch, and Lotte Department Store Busan main branch.

SJ currently has a portfolio of five brands, including Kangol, Helen Kaminski, LCDC and Le Conte Des Contes. 



Founded in 1927, Pan Am, an abbreviation for Pan American World Airways, was the largest international air carrier and unofficial flag carrier of the US during the 20th Century. An American drama series created by writer Jack Orman was named after the airline in 2011. The brand was also featured in the famous movie ‘Catch Me If You Can’ with Leonardo DiCaprio as a con artist disguising himself as a pilot of Pan Am.";PanAm return as retail store;"- **Pan Am Brand:** ✈️ Originally an airline, **Pan American World Airways** was the largest US air carrier in the 20th century.

This article is more than 1 year old
With more cassette tapes being bought than since 2003, readers tell why they prefer them to modern music players

Sales of cassettes in the UK have reached their highest level since 2003, following vinyl records in a small, nostalgia-fuelled resurgence. Five readers told us why they prefer to listen to supposedly obsolete tapes.

‘You have no way to skip tracks, which makes it more special’

Dan White and his collection
“Buying a cassette direct from an independent artist on platforms such as Bandcamp is such a fun way to consume music. Often produced in very small runs, it is nice to receive something though the post that is relatively scarce. In these days of Spotify funnelling payments only to the superstars, it feels good to support small artists and labels. I love vinyl, too, but the magic of a cassette is that you have no way to skip tracks; you press ‘play’ and listen from start to finish with only the satisfying thud of one side ending to interrupt the experience. The noisy, tactile controls of a cassette player are the perfect tonic to the ways most of us consume media throughout the day, making it more of a special event and something to look forward to.” Dan White, 40, Norwich

“There seems to be a huge 90s revival in fashion and classic TV from when I was a kid. My daughter, 12, has had a cassette player bought for her birthday, and is now listening to all the music I did growing up. Ebay and local record stores have been great for finding 90s music and she loves my old mix tapes. She listens to all kinds of music, but she asked specifically for Bon Jovi and Aerosmith tapes, which we bought for her birthday. She also wants Guns N’ Roses, Abba, East 17, but we haven’t got those yet. All her friends loved it when she took it to school.” Elisabeth Stagg, 38, Upminster

‘They have more depth than CDs – I know this is technically wrong’

Tim’s cassette player, and his eclectic tapes
“I listen to cassettes daily. And vinyl, and CDs. It depends what I want to listen to and which format it’s on. Cassettes, though – and I know this is technically wrong – sound as though they have much more depth than the CDs. I’ve tried one after the other and believe I can hear a better sound from the cassette. With a twin cassette deck hooked up to my 1986 Bang & Olufsen system, it means I have continuous music from two tapes playing both sides on a loop – unlike the single CD player or a vinyl record, which you have to turn over when one side is finished.” Tim, 50, Wiltshire

‘My co-worker sneaks into my office and changes the music to prog rock’

“After finally getting rid of my car with a cassette player in it, I’ve been given a radio cassette player, which is in my office with my old cassettes, from the Stranglers, the Kinks, and the Beatles to the LA’s, Pogues, Clannad and, most importantly, AC/DC, which I used to fall asleep to in my youth.


“My big brother died a few years ago and I have some of the tapes of his that I nicked from him when we were teenagers, such as Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple and UFO – he first got me into rock and metal. My co-worker is in the office next door, but I always know when he’s been sneaking in and working at my desk when the music has been surreptitiously changed to his prog rock stuff, which I no longer approve of. The machine I’m currently using was supplied by my partner and has extra big buttons designed for sight-impaired folk, or elderly folk such as myself.” Carole, 55, Huddersfield

‘Recording our music on tape made us take our jam sessions more seriously’

“The first album I ever bought was on cassette: Dire Straits, Brothers in Arms. Cassettes were my main way to consume music from childhood until I bought a Creative Zen MP3 player in the late noughties.

“I like to create my own music and collaborate with others. After rediscovering the atmosphere and sound of cassettes, I abandoned recording on to my laptop or PC and began using straight-to-audio cassette. I found this focused jam sessions. No longer would me and my friends just endlessly twiddle about for hours thinking, ‘we’ll sift through it all later’. Instead, there was physical tape being consumed and we only had so much of it, so we took the sessions more seriously. It wasn’t the intention when we started, but was a happy side-effect of recording on tape.” Charles Daniels, 45, Oxford";The return of Audio cassette;"- **Cassette Resurgence:**  Sales of cassettes in the UK are at their highest since **2003**, driven by nostalgia.

Whether it be because of nostalgia, a new market or just self-expression, the infamous grainy images have made a huge comeback — letting us know that maybe things don't always have to be picture perfect.

Polaroid first declared bankruptcy in 2001. By 2008, the company stopped producing instant film, the product that had once carried their massive profits throughout the 1980s and ‘90s. The age of digital photography had arrived, and Polaroid was doomed to live in the retrospectives and dusty attics of America for eternity, right?

Despite the functional demise of the company (it still exists as a licensing firm of sorts), Polaroid lives on as the all-encompassing label for any instant photography, even if it isn’t actually made by Polaroid themselves. Luckily, instant photography has made a monumental comeback in recent years, following in the footsteps of vinyl. Retro and analog media is the new aesthetic for millennials and Generation Z alike, and instant film has reaped the benefits of this once-niche craze.

The numbers of the instant film and analog media revival are staggering. Fujifilm, the new undisputed king of instant film, sold 3.5 million units of their Instax cameras in 2019, up from a measly 100,000 units in 2004. It’s no coincidence that vinyl shares this trajectory, with overall units sold going from approximately 1 million in 2005 to 27.5 million in 2020.

Ezoic
Instant film and analog media are not just passing fads. These figures are a sign that consumers desire more forms of media that they can physically see and touch, or maybe just bring them back to a simpler time.

The Intangibles 
The benefits of instant film are often intangible. If you ask someone why they prefer the grainy, imperfect images, they will most likely reply with something along the lines of “I don’t know, it’s just cool I guess?”

“I suppose with everything being crystal-clear and high definition today, to have an object or a moment with idiosyncrasies in it can somewhat appear to be more meaningful and memorable, maybe,” said photographer Harleigh English in an interview with Happy Mag.

Ezoic
English’s hypothesis about the allure of imperfection seems to be a driving force behind many of those who use instant film in today’s age. In fact, the form has become a favorite among professional photographers solely for that reason.

Digital photography does have many benefits. Minimal costs after upfront purchase, being able to take thousands of photos on a whim and pure flexibility via numerous lenses are just a few. To many like fashion photographer Emily Soto, though, it’s that lack of features that make instant film so attractive.

“One of the greatest things about shooting with Polaroid, and film in general, is the fact that it makes me step back and think about what I’m aiming to capture,” Soto wrote in an article for Huffington Post. “With digital, it is easy to shoot so many frames in a short amount of time without taking the time to think through posing and emotion, for instance.”

Being able to hold the photo in your hands in the moment is also a huge allure for many professionals and amateurs alike. To many, there’s something about holding a tangible, physical picture instead of viewing it on a screen that makes every shot memorable. It feels as if you’ve captured a moment instead of just creating a file made up of colorful code.

Ezoic
This reach for more tangible art by younger generations is nothing new. Vinyl, instant film’s de facto soulmate in today’s market and households across America, has a similar draw. Temoor Iqbal, a street photographer out of London, explained this is in an interview with Happy Mag:

“The trend of young people embracing analogue photography is a reaction to the nature of the modern world,” Iqbal said. “We still crave and relish the tangible, almost as a reference point for our cultural understanding.”

Could it Just be Nostalgia?
 One could easily chalk this up to nostalgia alone. Millennials, one of the age groups fueling the aforementioned sales, grew up with the memory of instant Polaroid cameras and vinyl records. Just like with classic Ford Mustangs or “Full House,” nostalgia may be what is keeping this analog market afloat. Research has shown that nostalgia weakens our desire for money, and as such, the business of selling our nostalgia back to us is almost always a profitable path.

If you’re Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett from The Guardian, this latest instant film obsession is merely a depressing reminder that millennials cannot let go of the past.

Ezoic
“But I do wonder when my generation is going to start making its own aesthetic stamp on the world rather than looking to their parents for inspiration,” she wrote.

You only have to look at many peoples’ Instagram feeds to convince yourself of such an argument. Dozens of apps that “Polaroid” your pictures are used to take high definition, digital photos and turn them into something reminiscent of that ever-nostalgic instant film aesthetic.

This certainly negates the argument that it’s all about the imperfections and tangibility of the film, and proves that many people may just want the latest Instax model to convince themselves they’re still in the ’80s.

Generation Z is the Key
However, what about Generation Z? Fujifilm itself has admitted that the Instax camera (their most popular instant film camera) was reimagined in 2012 with a target demographic of “young women and girls with an eye for fashion and art.” This isn’t exactly targeting 35-year-olds who want to relive the glory days.

Ezoic
In fact, the Instax camera has been around since 1998, with sales peaking in 2002 and then dropping off every year for nearly a decade after. Its resurgence in 2009 and 2010 was a surprise to most employees, as young, urban Japanese people began to pick up the “toy” camera as an alternative to the digital apocalypse that had engulfed the camera industry. According to Fujilfim, “these young people were looking for ‘new’ methods of self-expression.”

This interest in self-expression is something Generation Z is known for, specifically with what products they consume. According to McKinsey & Company, Generation Z’s spending habits are geared toward more personalized products, and they are willing to pay higher prices for them. Fujifilm’s Instax is the perfect product for this generation, even if they didn’t realize it.

The nature of instant photography allows for every shot to be unique, and in the process makes your average 12 to 25-year-old feel as if they’re expressing their individuality.

The price of instant film, up to $1 a shot, was also an obstacle for many people after the rise of much cheaper digital options. With Generation Z more willing to pay a higher premium for self-expression, the Instax and instant film industry in general have been able to overcome this.

Whatever the Reason…
Whether it’s the intangible feeling it brings, nostalgia or lucky marketing aimed at a new generation, one thing is for certain: “Polaroid” film, vinyl and other analog media is here to stay.";The return of instant camera;"- **Polaroid's History:**  Polaroid declared bankruptcy in **2001** and stopped making instant film by **2008**.

Digital cameras from the early 2000s are becoming must-have gadgets for many young people because of a burgeoning trend online.

Search traffic for old kit on online marketplaces like eBay and Etsy is on the rise.

And in the past 12 months, videos with the hashtag #digitalcamera have amassed more than 220 million views on TikTok.

Analysts describe the trend as being linked to similar revivals of turn of the century fashion.

Scott Ewart, 32, who lives on the Isle of Arran, has clocked up more than five million likes on his TikTok account, using what is now considered retro kit.

He said: ""A lot of folk find them quite comforting. It reminds them of their childhood, it reminds them of simpler times.

Scott Ewart/@SingleCamScott Scott Ewart with old 2000s digital camerasScott Ewart/@SingleCamScott
Scott Ewart first got into using old cameras during lockdown
""I find it quite refreshing going back to something so simple. With older cameras you have to work with them a bit more, to get a good photo or to get the most out of them.

""Because with every smartphone you buy, you can't take a bad shot almost.""

Scott started by digging out old cameras belonging to his parents, but has quickly expanded his collection to more than 30 pieces of kit.

Scott said he has to ""work with"" old digital cameras to get a good shot
He added: ""I get folk asking me, 'where do you edit these photos, are they edited?'. And I always say these are never edited and I want to show exactly how they've come out on every camera.""

EBay UK told the BBC the last three months of 2022 saw increases in people seeking the devices. This included a 13% rise in search traffic for ""vintage digital camera"", and a 52% rise for ""refurbished camera"".

Etsy, which focuses on handmade and vintage items, has also seen a growing interest from shoppers in the last six months. It currently has more than 19,000 items linked to digital cameras listed online.

Katie said the images open up a ""nostalgic world"" for younger people
Katie Glasgow, 25, lives in Brooklyn, New York and calls herself ""the oldest possible Gen Z"". She has also been using her parents' old kit to make images and video.

""It looks like memories, because it's blurry and imperfect. It looks more like how we remember things,"" she said.

For younger people, who will have virtually no recollection of these cameras in their 2000s heyday, this opens up a kind of ""nostalgic world"", she said.

""These are the cameras my older sister took to prom or my brother had in college, or my young childhood memories were recorded on.

""With your phone you can take videos and pictures of literally everything. So your library is huge, versus with this you kind of have to decide, 'this is a moment I actually want to preserve'.

Katie Glasgow/@katie.glasgow Interior of arcade taken by Katie Glasgow on 2000s digital cameraKatie Glasgow/@katie.glasgow
Older digital cameras create ""blurry and imperfect"" images, Katie said

All the growth in the music business now comes from old songs—how did we get here, and is there a way back?
Ted Gioia
Jan 19, 2022

I had a hunch that old songs were taking over music streaming platforms—but even I was shocked when I saw the most recent numbers. According to MRC Data, old songs now represent 70% of the US music market.

Those who make a living from new music—especially that endangered species known as the working musician—have to look on these figures with fear and trembling.

But the news gets worse.


Source: MRC Data
The new music market is actually shrinking. All the growth in the market is coming from old songs.

Just consider these facts: the 200 most popular tracks now account for less than 5% of total streams. It was twice that rate just three years ago. And the mix of songs actually purchased by consumers is even more tilted to older music—the current list of most downloaded tracks on iTunes is filled with the names of bands from the last century, such as Creedence Clearwater and The Police.

I saw it myself last week at a retail store, where the youngster at the cash register was singing along with Sting on “Message in a Bottle” (a hit from 1979) as it blasted on the radio. A few days earlier, I had a similar experience at a local diner, where the entire staff was under thirty but every song more than forty years old. I asked my server: “Why are you playing this old music?” She looked at me in surprise before answering: “Oh, I like these songs.”

The reasons are complex—more than just the appeal of old tunes—but the end result is unmistakable: Never before in history have new tracks attained hit status while generating so little cultural impact. In fact, the audience seems to be embracing en masse the hits of decades past. Success was always short-lived in the music business, but now it hardly makes a ripple on the attention spans of the mass market.

A few hearty souls take solace in the fact that only songs released in the last 18 months get classified as new in the MRC database. But that’s cold comfort indeed. I doubt these old playlists consist of songs from the year before last—and even if they do, this still represents a stinging repudiation of the pop culture industry, which is almost entirely focused on what’s happening right now.


Old recordings, like zombies in those bad films, are out to kill the living
Every week I hear from hundreds of publicists, record labels, band managers, and other professionals who want to hype the newest new thing—for the simple reason that their livelihoods depend on it. The entire business model of the music industry is built on promoting new songs. As a music writer, I’m expected to do the same—as are radio stations, retailers, DJs, nightclub owners, editors, playlist curators, and everyone else with skin in the game. Yet all the evidence indicates that few are paying attention.

Just consider the recent reaction when the Grammy Awards were postponed. Perhaps I should say the lack of reaction—because the response was little more than a yawn. I follow thousands of music professionals on social media, and I didn’t encounter a single expression of annoyance or regret that the biggest annual event in new music had been put on hold.

That’s ominous.

Can you imagine how angry fans would be if the Super Bowl or NBA Finals were delayed? People would riot in the streets. If they cancelled Carnival in Rio or even just Bloomsday in Dublin, I’d hear an outcry on social media. But the Grammy Awards go missing in action, and hardly anyone notices.

The declining TV audience for the Grammy show underscores this shift. In 2021, viewership for the Grammy Awards collapsed 53% from the previous year—from 18.7 million to 8.8 million. It was the least-watched Grammy broadcast of all time. Even the core audience for new music couldn’t be bothered—around 98% of people between the ages of 18 and 49 had something better to do than watch the biggest music celebration of the year.

A decade ago, 40 million people watched the Grammy Awards. That’s a meaningful audience, but now the devoted fans of this event are starting to resemble a tiny subculture. More people pay attention to streams of video games on Twitch (which now boasts 30 million daily visitors) or the latest reality TV show. In fact, musicians would probably do better getting placement in Fortnite than signing a record deal in 2022. At least they would have access to a growing demographic.

Some would like to believe this is just a short term blip, perhaps caused by the pandemic. When clubs open up again, and DJs start spinning new records at parties, the world will return to normal—or so we’re told. The hottest songs will again be the newest songs.

I’m not so optimistic. 

A perfect storm has hit the music ecosystem. A series of unfortunate events are conspiring to marginalize new music. The pandemic is one of these ugly facts, but hardly the only contributor to the growing crisis.

Consider these other trends:

The hottest area of investment in the music business is old songs—with investment firms getting into bidding wars to buy publishing catalogs from aging rock and pop stars.

The song catalogs in most demand are by musicians in their 70s or 80s (Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen, etc.)—if not already dead (David Bowie, James Brown, etc.).  

Even major record labels are participating in the shift, with Universal Music, Sony Music, Warner Music, and others buying up publishing catalogs—investing huge sums in old tunes that, in an earlier day, would have been used to launch new artists.

The hottest technology in music is a format that is more than 70 years old, the vinyl LP. There’s no sign that the record labels are investing in a newer, better alternative—because, here too, old is viewed as superior to new.

In fact, record labels—once a source of innovation in consumer products—don’t spend any money on research & development to revitalize their businesses, although every other industry looks to innovation for growth and consumer excitement.

Record stores are caught up in the same time warp. In an earlier day, they aggressively marketed new music, but now they make more money from vinyl reissues and used LPs.

Radio stations are contributing to the stagnation, putting fewer new songs into their rotation, or—judging by the offerings on my satellite radio lineup—completely ignoring new music in favor of old hits.

When a new song overcomes these obstacles and actually becomes a hit, the risk of copyright lawsuits is greater than ever before. The risks have increased enormously since the “Blurred Lines” jury decision of 2015—with the result that additional cash gets transferred from today’s musicians to old (or deceased) artists.

Adding to the nightmare, dead musicians are now coming back to life in virtual form—via holograms and deepfake music—making it all the harder for a young, living artist to compete in the marketplace

As record labels lose interest in new music, emerging performers desperately search for other ways of getting exposure. They hope to get their self-produced tracks on a curated streaming playlist, or license their songs for use in advertising or the closing credits of a TV show. But here’s the problem—these options might generate some royalty income, but do little to build name recognition.

You might hear a cool song on a TV commercial, but do you even know the name of the artist?  You love your workout playlist at the health club, but how many song titles and band names do you remember? You stream a Spotify new music playlist in the background while you work, but did you bother to learn who’s singing the songs?

Decades ago, composer Erik Satie announced the arrival of ‘furniture music’—a kind of song that would blend seamlessly into the background of our lives. That seemed like a radical notion at the time, but this vision of the future is rapidly turning into the banal reality of today. And the lack of excitement among consumers is palpable.

Some people—especially baby boomers—tell me that this decline in music is simply the result of lousy new songs. Music used to be better, or so they say. The old songs had better melodies, more interesting harmonies, and demonstrated genuine musicianship, not just software loops, Auto-Tuned vocals, and regurgitated samples.

There will never be another Sondheim, they tell me. Or Joni Mitchell. Or Bob Dylan. Or Cole Porter. Or Brian Wilson. I almost expect these doomsayers to break out in a stirring rendition of “Old Time Rock and Roll,” much like Tom Cruise in his underpants.

Just take those old records off the shelf
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself. . .

I can understand the frustrations of music lovers getting no satisfaction from the current songs, though they try and they try. I also lament the lack of imagination on many current hits. But I disagree with their larger verdict. I listen to 2-3 hours of new music every day, and I know that there are plenty of outstanding young musicians out there. The problem isn’t that they don’t exist, but that the music industry has lost its ability to discover and nurture their talents.


There are many reasons for this, some of them quite alarming. For example, the fear of copyright lawsuits has made many in the music industry deathly afraid of listening to unsolicited demo recordings. If you hear a demo today, you might get sued for stealing its melody—or maybe just its rhythmic groove—five years from now. Try mailing a demo to a label or producer, and watch it return unopened.

That’s a bizarre situation, no? The people whose livelihood depends on discovering new musical talent face legal risks if they take their job seriously. And that’s only one of the deleterious results of the music industry’s over-reliance on lawyers and litigation—a hardass approach they once hoped would cure all their problems, but now does more harm than good. Everybody suffers in this litigious environment, except for the partners at the entertainment law firms, who enjoy the abundant fruits of all these lawsuits and legal threats.

But the problem goes much deeper than just copyright concerns. The people running the music industry have lost confidence in new music. They won’t admit it publicly—that would be like the priests of Jupiter and Apollo in ancient Rome admitting that their gods are dead. Even if they know it’s true, their job titles won’t allow such a humble and abject confession. Yet that is exactly what’s happening in the music business. The moguls have lost their faith in the redemptive and life-changing power of new music—how sad is that? Of course, the decision-makers need to pretend that they still believe in the future of their business, and want to discover the next revolutionary talent—but that’s not what they really think. Their actions speak much louder than their empty words.

In fact, nothing is less interesting to music executives than a completely radical new kind of music. Who can blame them? The radio stations will only play songs that fit the dominant formulas, which haven’t changed much in decades. That’s even more true for the algorithms curating so much of our new music—the algorithms are designed to be feedback loops, ensuring that the promoted new songs are virtually identical to your favorite old songs. Anything that genuinely breaks the mold is excluded from consideration almost as a rule. That’s actually how the current system has been designed to work.

Even the music genres famous for shaking up the world—rock or jazz or hip-hop—face this same deadening industry mindset. I love jazz, but many of the radio stations focused on that genre play songs that sound almost the same as what they featured ten or twenty years ago. In many instances, they actually are the same songs.

That doesn’t have to be the case. A lot of musicians around the world—especially in Los Angeles and London—are conducting a bold dialogue between jazz and other contemporary styles. They are even bringing jazz back as dance music. But the songs they release sound dangerously different from older jazz, and are thus excluded from many radio stations for that very reason. The very boldness with which they embrace the future becomes the reason why they get rejected by the gatekeepers.

The same thing is happening everywhere. A country record needs to sound a certain way to get played on most country radio stations or playlists—and that sound dates back to the last century. And don’t even get me started on classical music, which works hard to avoid showcasing the creativity of the current generation. We are living in an amazing era of classical composition—with one tiny problem: the institutions controlling the genre don’t want you to hear it.

So the problem isn’t a lack of good new music. It’s an institutional failure to discover and nurture it.

I learned the danger of excessive caution long ago, when I consulted to huge Fortune 500 companies. The single biggest problem I encountered—shared by virtually every large company I analyzed—was investing too much of their time and money into defending old ways of doing business, rather than building new ones. We even had a proprietary tool for quantifying this misallocation of resources—which spelled out the mistakes in precise dollars and cents.

But senior management hated hearing this, and always insisted that defending the old business units was their safest bet. After I encountered this embedded mindset again and again and saw its consequences, I reached the painful conclusion that the safest path is often the most dangerous. If you pursue a strategy—whether in business or your personal life—that avoids all risk, you might flourish in the short run, but you flounder over the long term. Sad to say, that’s what now happening in the music business. Keep your head in the sand long enough, and you suffocate.

The leading companies in music had many chances to reinvent themselves over the last quarter century, taking bold action that might have transformed themselves and the entire culture. But they didn’t want to take any risks. They could have invested in new technologies—but didn’t, instead allowing Silicon Valley companies to swallow up most of the profits from music in the 21st century. They could have signed and nurtured new talent—but didn’t, preferring to invest in 50-year-old songs. They could have embraced exciting new sounds—but didn’t because the algorithms and dominant formulas reward rehashes of the old sounds.

Even so, I refuse to accept that we are in some ugly endgame, witnessing the death throes of new music. And I say that because I know how much people crave something that sounds fresh and exciting and different. If they don’t find it from a major record label or algorithm-driven playlist, they will find it somewhere else. Things can go viral nowadays without the entertainment industry even noticing until it has actually happened. And that will be how this story ends—not with the marginalization of new music, but with something radical emerging from an unexpected place.

In fact, that’s how all the apparent dead ends of the past were circumvented. Music company execs in 1955 had no idea that rock ‘n’ roll would soon sweep away everything in its wake. When Elvis took over the culture—coming from the poorest state in the US, lowly Mississippi—they were more shocked than anybody. And it happened again the following decade, with the arrival of the British Invasion from lowly Liverpool (again a working class city, unnoticed by the entertainment industry). And it took place again when hip-hop emerged from the Bronx and South Central and other impoverished neighborhoods, a true grass roots movement that didn’t give a damn how the close-minded CEOs of Sony or Universal Music viewed the marketplace.

And if we had the time, I would tell you that the same thing has always happened—with the troubadours of 11th century or Sappho and the lyric singers of ancient Greece or the artisan performers of the Middle Kingdom in ancient Egypt. Musical revolutions come from the bottom up, not the top down.

The CEOs are the last to know.

That’s what gives me solace. New music always arises in the least expected place, and when the power brokers aren’t even paying attention. And it will happen again just like that. It certainly needs to. Because the decision-makers controlling our music institutions have lost the thread.

8fd9dec1;4fdedf7b;;a247e01a;f0afabff;History;;34324;"A Brief History of Salons

Molly Molly  4 years agoshare
Salons are nothing new, humans have been gathering together to discuss and debate ideas, and to share and savor new literature and music for centuries. They fall in and out of trend depending on the era, but for a solid 400 years or so, from about 1500 – 1900, salons were popular across Europe. The term salon suggests some modicum of regularity, say, weekly, (alright, that’s too much! Monthly ok!) and with that regularity came conversation, connection and community. Sometimes salons centered around a specific theme like poetry and at other times they were more general in scope. But the one central theme amongst them all was that the focus was on listening and speaking to each other, learning from those around you, your fellow guests at the salon. 

While the roots of the salon can be found in Ancient Greece and Rome, the first recorded salons took place in Italy in the 15th Century, and these were a precursor to the Enlightenment Period. They were an opportunity for artists, poets, musicians, thinkers, the Renaissance intellectual glitteratti and their hangers-on, to come together across social classes to hob-nob and share ideas out of the scrutiny of the Roman Catholic Church.


Noble women hosted these Italian salons and even then, the host was seen as inspired, bright and a trend-setter. Isabella d’Este (1474-1533) and Elisabetta Gonzaga (1471 – 1526) were sister-in-laws in Renaissance Italy who hosted salons that had a huge reach. The two of them wrote letters back and forth to each other often so the intricacies of their lives are well-documented. Their salons were written about by Baldassare Castiglionein in The Book of the Courtier, which set the standards for how one was to behave, speak and dress at these Italian Renaissance salons. They are credited with having had such an influence with their gatherings that France picked up on the trend and thus, the world of French salons was born.



Once neighboring France picked up on the trend, they ran with it all the way back to the Rue St. Honore in Paris. If you’ve heard of salons before, what likely comes to mind are the French salons of the 17th and 18th Centuries where philosophers, authors, musicians, poets and other interesting and educated people with points of view came together to talk and share ideas about science, politics, literature and art. (Salons were happening across Europe but were particularly popular and influential in France). So analog! 

Like in Italy, these salons were hosted by prominent, educated women in their private homes. The female hosts (later the term salonniere became used) did all the inviting and curated the evening of conversation, art and music. It was a rare chance for a woman to be both in control and have some freedom of expression in the male-dominated world and to be at the epicenter of the exchange of important ideas.


Women were not allowed formal education during this time, so the salons also provided an acceptable way to educate oneself. Woe-betide you if you got on the wrong side of the salon host; you would not be invited back. And you couldn’t just walk up to a salon evening at someone’s home and attend as a guest, absolutely not. You needed a letter of introduction. That’s not so different from now of course, if you were having a dinner party that looked all twinkly and inviting from the sidewalk, you wouldn’t just let anyone in off the street to attend. Obviously not!

One of the most infamous early salon hosts in France was Catherine de Vivonne, the Marquess de Rambouillet. Hailing originally from Italy, she found the French Court not to her taste. She set up her home called the Hotel de Rambouillet as a place for the educated to gather upon invitation, and made it warm and welcoming for people to come over and speak intimately and openly. Everyone who was anyone with an original thought during that came through Catherine’s home during the mid-1600’s. Now that’s quite the salon host!  

The most well-known French salonista pioneer to immediately follow in her footsteps was Madeleine de Scudéry. Known for creating her own ideal of a feminist utopia within her salon, she strictly forbade romantic and sexual love, as she herself was devoutly celibate. Emulating the format perfected by Marquess de Rambouillet, de Scudéry declared her salon to be its own sovereign country within her heart, and even created a map of how to achieve that status of her affections called La Carte de Tendre (Tender Card). Her era of hosting still reflected a time when an invitation to her salon was a rite of passage into Parisian aristocracy. So to successfully reach the most tender part of her heart by way of La Carte de Tendre, in a way became its own form of social nobility.


What was extraordinary about the earlier 18th Century salons in France is that they brought people from different economic classes together (unlike, say, the court at Versailles which was just the very fanciest people, the nobility) and let them exchange ideas openly in a safe setting. In a private home in a pleasing room you didn’t have to worry someone was going to chop your head off later that night because they disagreed with you, radical! Certainly we could learn from that today, and this is what makes salons so very timely and valuable both in this age as well as hundreds of years ago.


This period during the 1700s into early 1800s was called the Enlightenment, and it was a time when free-thinking flourished. That is, having your own point of view – to be listening and learning and debating ideas, was celebrated during this time. It was not cool to be dumbing oneself down amongst the fashionable and bright salon-going crowd, and the French believed that an educated and enlightened society was for the good of all. 

With the French Revolution came Napoleon marching in and salons took a bit of a turn under his rule, becoming less radical and more formal. Perhaps they were less interesting intellectually too, as Napoleon did not want to encourage too much free-thinking amongst his people, and firmly believed the powerful position women occupied as hostesses was fundamentally dangerous. He banished one particularly controversial salonista, Germaine de Staël, who was not allowed to come ‘within 40 leagues of Paris’ for ten years beginning in 1803. According to the Memoirs of Madame de Rémusat, another member of the French royal family, Napoleon said she “teaches people to think who had never thought before, or who had forgotten how to think.”

Salons sort of fizzled out in France in the first half of the 1800’s and then returned later in the century with a focus on modern art exhibitions and literature, paving the way for a new era of art-focused salons in the 20th century. Paris continued to be the pulse of the world’s most influential salons, a legacy most famously carried on by wealthy American ex-patriots and authors Natalie Clifford Barney and Gertrude Stein.

The two shared a great deal of overlap in both their personal lives and salon guestlists, and eventually became friends. Both were open lesbians of Jewish descent who became iconic feminist authors, and both hosted the likes of Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound and many more in their weekly salons. Natalie’s place in Paris had an old Masonic temple tucked into the garden, which she deemed The Temple of Friendship. Her salon ran for 60 years, with a a few years of hiatus during World War II because Natalie had to flee to Italy in order to escape Nazi occupation. She returned to Paris in 1949 and resumed her Friday night salon.


Gertrude Stein’s brother Leo, with whom she lived in Paris, became an early patron of Picasso and other highly influential modern artists, naturally bringing them to her weekly salons. Early collectors of Matisse, Cezanne and Renoir paintings, Gertrude’s salons in the Stein home became an equally powerful a magnet for the most brilliant minds in literature. From 1910 on Gertrude lived with her life-partner, fellow American and writer Alice B. Tolkas, about whom she would later write The Autobiography of Alice B. Tolkas. Deemed the ‘Mother of Modernism,’ the creators who passed through Gertrude’s salons defined the modernist movement in both literature and art in the early part of the 20th century.


Gertrude and Alice bravely stayed in Paris even after German occupation began. World War II devastated much of Europe and with it most of the salons of the day. Their hey-day ran parallel with the salons of the Weimar Republic as well as A’lelia Walker’s famous salons of the Harlem Renaissance from 1915-1930, which attracted iconic writers like Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. A’lelia Walker helped launch a multi-million dollar direct-to-consumer beauty products company with her and became the premiere arts patron, philanthropist and salonista of her time.


And she wasn’t the only woman hosting salons in Harlem back then either, author Zora Neale Hurston, Ruth Logan Roberts and Georgia Douglas Johnson were also bringing together leading figures of the day in African-American politics, art and literature. These salons arguably propelled the revival of African American culture referred to as the Harlem Renaissance.

Salons popped up again in Hollywood and New York City in the mid-20th century, but many became rightly or wrongly associated with Communism and were disbanded amidst the Red Scare under the scrutiny of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Most notably Salka Viertel’s salon of World War II exiles-turned-showbiz-folks (patroned by Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo and Albert Einstein!) in Santa Monica became the subject of FBI interest and disbanded in the mid-1950s.

Suffice to say the social alchemy of salons have a long and fascinating history of ushering in paradigm-shifting ideas born of more broad perspectives, and as a result often ruffling the feathers of established socio-political power structures. Doesn’t the time feel ripe to create more where that came from?

young person standing on a rock outcropping with their arms up looking out at mountains in the distance
Paul Seli, PhD, is falling asleep. As he nods off, a sleep-tracking glove called Dormio, developed by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, detects his nascent sleep state and jars him awake. Pulled back from the brink, he jots down the artistic ideas that came to him during those semilucid moments.

Seli is an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences and also an artist. He uses Dormio to tap into the world of hypnagogia, the transitional state that exists at the boundary between wakefulness and sleep. In a mini-experiment, he created a series of paintings inspired by ideas plucked from his hypnagogic state and another series from ideas that came to him during waking hours. Then he asked friends to rate how creative the paintings were, without telling them which were which. They judged the hypnagogic paintings as significantly more creative. “In dream states, we seem to be able to link things together that we normally wouldn’t connect,” Seli said. “It’s like there’s an artist in my brain that I get to know through hypnagogia.”

The experiment is one of many novel—and, yes, creative—ways that psychologists are studying the science of creativity. At an individual level, creativity can lead to personal fulfillment and positive academic and professional outcomes, and even be therapeutic. People take pleasure in creative thoughts, research suggests—even if they don’t think of themselves as especially creative. Beyond those individual benefits, creativity is an endeavor with implications for society, said Jonathan Schooler, PhD, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “Creativity is at the core of innovation. We rely on innovation for advancing humanity, as well as for pleasure and entertainment,” he said. “Creativity underlies so much of what humans value.”

In 1950, J. P. Guilford, PhD, then president of APA, laid out his vision for the psychological study of creativity (American Psychologist, Vol. 5, No. 9, 1950). For half a century, researchers added to the scientific understanding of creativity incrementally, said John Kounios, PhD, an experimental psychologist who studies creativity and insight at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Much of that research focused on the personality traits linked to creativity and the cognitive aspects of the creative process.

But in the 21st century, the field has blossomed thanks to new advances in neuroimaging. “It’s become a tsunami of people studying creativity,” Kounios said. Psychologists and neuroscientists are uncovering new details about what it means to be creative and how to nurture that skill. “Creativity is of incredible real-world value,” Kounios said. “The ultimate goal is to figure out how to enhance it in a systematic way.”


Creativity in the brain
What, exactly, is creativity? The standard definition used by researchers characterizes creative ideas as those that are original and effective, as described by psychologist Mark A. Runco, PhD, director of creativity research and programming at Southern Oregon University (Creativity Research Journal, Vol. 24, No. 1, 2012). But effectiveness, also called utility, is a slippery concept. Is a poem useful? What makes a sculpture effective? “Most researchers use some form of this definition, but most of us are also dissatisfied with it,” Kounios said.

Runco is working on an updated definition and has considered at least a dozen suggestions from colleagues for new components to consider. One frequently suggested feature is authenticity. “Creativity involves an honest expression,” he said.

Meanwhile, scientists are also struggling with the best way to measure the concept. As a marker of creativity, researchers often measure divergent thinking—the ability to generate a lot of possible solutions to a problem or question. The standard test of divergent thinking came from Guilford himself. Known as the alternate-uses test, the task asks participants to come up with novel uses for a common object such as a brick. But measures of divergent thinking haven’t been found to correlate well with real-world creativity. Does coming up with new uses for a brick imply a person will be good at abstract art or composing music or devising new methods for studying the brain? “It strikes me as using way too broad a brush,” Seli said. “I don’t think we measure creativity in the standard way that people think about creativity. As researchers, we need to be very clear about what we mean.”

One way to do that may be to move away from defining creativity based on a person’s creative output and focus instead on what’s going on in the brain, said Adam Green, PhD, a cognitive neuroscientist at Georgetown University and founder of the Society for the Neuroscience of Creativity. “The standard definition, that creativity is novel and useful, is a description of a product,” he noted. “By looking inward, we can see the process in action and start to identify the characteristics of creative thought. Neuroimaging is helping to shift the focus from creative product to creative process.”

That process seems to involve the coupling of disparate brain regions. Specifically, creativity often involves coordination between the cognitive control network, which is involved in executive functions such as planning and problem-solving, and the default mode network, which is most active during mind-wandering or daydreaming (Beaty, R. E., et al., Cerebral Cortex, Vol. 31, No. 10, 2021). The cooperation of those networks may be a unique feature of creativity, Green said. “These two systems are usually antagonistic. They rarely work together, but creativity seems to be one instance where they do.”

Green has also found evidence that an area called the frontopolar cortex, in the brain’s frontal lobes, is associated with creative thinking. And stimulating the area seems to boost creative abilities. He and his colleagues used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate the frontopolar cortex of participants as they tried to come up with novel analogies. Stimulating the area led participants to make analogies that were more semantically distant from one another—in other words, more creative (Cerebral Cortex, Vol. 27, No. 4, 2017).

Green’s work suggests that targeting specific areas in the brain, either with neuromodulation or cognitive interventions, could enhance creativity. Yet no one is suggesting that a single brain region, or even a single neural network, is responsible for creative thought. “Creativity is not one system but many different mechanisms that, under ideal circumstances, work together in a seamless way,” Kounios said.

In search of the eureka moment
Creativity looks different from person to person. And even within one brain, there are different routes to a creative spark, Kounios explained. One involves what cognitive scientists call “System 1” (also called “Type 1”) processes: quick, unconscious thoughts—aha moments—that burst into consciousness. A second route involves “System 2” processes: thinking that is slow, deliberate, and conscious. “Creativity can use one or the other or a combination of the two,” he said. “You might use Type 1 thinking to generate ideas and Type 2 to critique and refine them.”

Which pathway a person uses might depend, in part, on their expertise. Kounios and his colleagues used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine what was happening in jazz musicians’ brains as they improvised on the piano. Then skilled jazz instructors rated those improvisations for creativity, and the researchers compared each musician’s most creative compositions. They found that for highly experienced musicians, the mechanisms used to generate creative ideas were largely automatic and unconscious, and they came from the left posterior part of the brain. Less-experienced pianists drew on more analytical, deliberative brain processes in the right frontal region to devise creative melodies, as Kounios and colleagues described in a special issue of NeuroImage on the neuroscience of creativity (Vol. 213, 2020). “It seems there are at least two pathways to get from where you are to a creative idea,” he said.

Coming up with an idea is only one part of the creative process. A painter needs to translate their vision to canvas. An inventor has to tinker with their concept to make a prototype that actually works. Still, the aha moment is an undeniably important component of the creative process. And science is beginning to illuminate those “lightbulb moments.”

Kounios examined the relationship between creative insight and the brain’s reward system by asking participants to solve anagrams in the lab. In people who were highly sensitive to rewards, a creative insight led to a burst of brain activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, the area of the brain that responds to basic pleasures like delicious food or addictive drugs (NeuroImage, Vol. 214, 2020). That neural reward may explain, from an evolutionary standpoint, why humans seem driven to create, he said. “We seem wired to take pleasure in creative thoughts. There are neural rewards for thinking in a creative fashion, and that may be adaptive for our species.”

The rush you get from an aha moment might also signal that you’re onto something good, Schooler said. He and his colleagues studied these flashes of insight among creative writers and physicists. They surveyed the participants daily for two weeks, asking them to note their creative ideas and when they occurred. Participants reported that about a fifth of the most important ideas of the day happened when they were mind-wandering and not working on a task at hand (Psychological Science, Vol. 30, No. 3, 2019). “These solutions were more likely to be associated with an aha moment and often overcoming an impasse of some sort,” Schooler said.

Six months later, the participants revisited those ideas and rated them for creative importance. This time, they rated their previous ideas as creative, but less important than they’d initially thought. That suggests that the spark of a eureka moment may not be a reliable clue that an idea has legs. “It seems like the aha experience may be a visceral marker of an important idea. But the aha experience can also inflate the meaningfulness of an idea that doesn’t have merit,” Schooler said. “We have to be careful of false ahas.”

Boosting your creativity
Much of the research in this realm has focused on creativity as a trait. Indeed, some people are naturally more creative than others. Creative individuals are more likely than others to possess the personality trait of openness. “Across different age groups, the best predictor of creativity is openness to new experiences,” said Anna Abraham, PhD, the E. Paul Torrance Professor and director of the Torrance Center for Creativity and Talent Development at the University of Georgia. “Creative people have the kind of curiosity that draws them toward learning new things and experiencing the world in new ways,” she said.

We can’t all be Thomas Edison or Maya Angelou. But creativity is also a state, and anyone can push themselves to be more creative. “Creativity is human capacity, and there’s always room for growth,” Runco said. A tolerant environment is often a necessary ingredient, he added. “Tolerant societies allow individuals to express themselves and explore new things. And as a parent or a teacher, you can model that creativity is valued and be open-minded when your child gives an answer you didn’t expect.”

One way to let your own creativity flow may be by tapping into your untethered mind. Seli is attempting to do so through his studies on hypnagogia. After pilot testing the idea on himself, he’s now working on a study that uses the sleep-tracking glove to explore creativity in a group of Duke undergrads. “In dream states, there seems to be connectivity between disparate ideas. You tend to link things together you normally wouldn’t, and this should lead to novel outcomes,” he said. “Neurally speaking, the idea is to increase connectivity between different areas of the brain.”

You don’t have to be asleep to forge those creative connections. Mind-wandering can also let the ideas flow. “Letting yourself daydream with a purpose, on a regular basis, might allow brain networks that don’t usually cooperate to literally form stronger connections,” Green said.

However, not all types of daydreams will get you there. Schooler found that people who engage in more personally meaningful daydreams (such as fantasizing about a future vacation or career change) report greater artistic achievement and more daily inspiration. People who are prone to fantastical daydreaming (such as inventing alternate realities or imaginary worlds) produced higher-quality creative writing in the lab and reported more daily creative behavior. But daydreams devoted to planning or problem-solving were not associated with creative behaviors (Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts, Vol. 15, No. 4, 2021).

It’s not just what you think about when you daydream, but where you are when you do it. Some research suggests spending time in nature can enhance creativity. That may be because of the natural world’s ability to restore attention, or perhaps it’s due to the tendency to let your mind wander when you’re in the great outdoors (Williams, K. J. H., et al., Journal of Environmental Psychology, Vol. 59, 2018). “A lot of creative figures go on walks in big, expansive environments. In a large space, your perceptual attention expands and your scope of thought also expands,” Kounios said. “That’s why working in a cubicle is bad for creativity. But working near a window can help.”

Wherever you choose to do it, fostering creativity requires time and effort. “People want the booster shot for creativity. But creativity isn’t something that comes magically. It’s a skill, and as with any new skill, the more you practice, the better you get,” Abraham said. In a not-yet-published study, she found three factors predicted peak originality in teenagers: openness to experience, intelligence, and, importantly, time spent engaged in creative hobbies. That is, taking the time to work on creative pursuits makes a difference. And the same is true for adults, she said. “Carve out time for yourself, figure out the conditions that are conducive to your creativity, and recognize that you need to keep pushing yourself. You won’t get to where you want to go if you don’t try.”

Those efforts can benefit your own sense of creative fulfillment and perhaps lead to rewards on an even grander scale. “I think everyday creativity is the most important kind,” Runco said. “If we can support the creativity of each and every individual, we’ll change the world.”

How to become more creative
1. Put in the work: People often think of creativity as a bolt of inspiration, like a lightbulb clicking on. But being creative in a particular domain—whether in the arts, in your work, or in your day-to-day life—is a skill. Carve out time to learn and practice.

2. Let your mind wander: Experts recommend “daydreaming with purpose.” Make opportunities to let your daydreams flow, while gently nudging them toward the creative challenge at hand. Some research suggests meditation may help people develop the habit of purposeful daydreaming.

3. Practice remote associations: Brainstorm ideas, jotting down whatever thoughts or notions come to you, no matter how wild. You can always edit later.

4. Go outside: Spending time in nature and wide-open spaces can expand your attention, enhance beneficial mind-wandering, and boost creativity.

5. Revisit your creative ideas: Aha moments can give you a high—but that rush might make you overestimate the merit of a creative idea. Don’t be afraid to revisit ideas to critique and tweak them later.";The science of creativity;"- **Understanding Creativity:**  Creativity is defined as the ability to generate **original** and **effective** ideas.

Paul Seli, PhD, is falling asleep. As he nods off, a sleep-tracking glove called Dormio, developed by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, detects his nascent sleep state and jars him awake. Pulled back from the brink, he jots down the artistic ideas that came to him during those semilucid moments.

Seli is an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences and also an artist. He uses Dormio to tap into the world of hypnagogia, the transitional state that exists at the boundary between wakefulness and sleep. In a mini-experiment, he created a series of paintings inspired by ideas plucked from his hypnagogic state and another series from ideas that came to him during waking hours. Then he asked friends to rate how creative the paintings were, without telling them which were which. They judged the hypnagogic paintings as significantly more creative. “In dream states, we seem to be able to link things together that we normally wouldn’t connect,” Seli said. “It’s like there’s an artist in my brain that I get to know through hypnagogia.”

The experiment is one of many novel—and, yes, creative—ways that psychologists are studying the science of creativity. At an individual level, creativity can lead to personal fulfillment and positive academic and professional outcomes, and even be therapeutic. People take pleasure in creative thoughts, research suggests—even if they don’t think of themselves as especially creative. Beyond those individual benefits, creativity is an endeavor with implications for society, said Jonathan Schooler, PhD, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “Creativity is at the core of innovation. We rely on innovation for advancing humanity, as well as for pleasure and entertainment,” he said. “Creativity underlies so much of what humans value.”

In 1950, J. P. Guilford, PhD, then president of APA, laid out his vision for the psychological study of creativity (American Psychologist, Vol. 5, No. 9, 1950). For half a century, researchers added to the scientific understanding of creativity incrementally, said John Kounios, PhD, an experimental psychologist who studies creativity and insight at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Much of that research focused on the personality traits linked to creativity and the cognitive aspects of the creative process.

But in the 21st century, the field has blossomed thanks to new advances in neuroimaging. “It’s become a tsunami of people studying creativity,” Kounios said. Psychologists and neuroscientists are uncovering new details about what it means to be creative and how to nurture that skill. “Creativity is of incredible real-world value,” Kounios said. “The ultimate goal is to figure out how to enhance it in a systematic way.”


Creativity in the brain
What, exactly, is creativity? The standard definition used by researchers characterizes creative ideas as those that are original and effective, as described by psychologist Mark A. Runco, PhD, director of creativity research and programming at Southern Oregon University (Creativity Research Journal, Vol. 24, No. 1, 2012). But effectiveness, also called utility, is a slippery concept. Is a poem useful? What makes a sculpture effective? “Most researchers use some form of this definition, but most of us are also dissatisfied with it,” Kounios said.

Runco is working on an updated definition and has considered at least a dozen suggestions from colleagues for new components to consider. One frequently suggested feature is authenticity. “Creativity involves an honest expression,” he said.

Meanwhile, scientists are also struggling with the best way to measure the concept. As a marker of creativity, researchers often measure divergent thinking—the ability to generate a lot of possible solutions to a problem or question. The standard test of divergent thinking came from Guilford himself. Known as the alternate-uses test, the task asks participants to come up with novel uses for a common object such as a brick. But measures of divergent thinking haven’t been found to correlate well with real-world creativity. Does coming up with new uses for a brick imply a person will be good at abstract art or composing music or devising new methods for studying the brain? “It strikes me as using way too broad a brush,” Seli said. “I don’t think we measure creativity in the standard way that people think about creativity. As researchers, we need to be very clear about what we mean.”

One way to do that may be to move away from defining creativity based on a person’s creative output and focus instead on what’s going on in the brain, said Adam Green, PhD, a cognitive neuroscientist at Georgetown University and founder of the Society for the Neuroscience of Creativity. “The standard definition, that creativity is novel and useful, is a description of a product,” he noted. “By looking inward, we can see the process in action and start to identify the characteristics of creative thought. Neuroimaging is helping to shift the focus from creative product to creative process.”

That process seems to involve the coupling of disparate brain regions. Specifically, creativity often involves coordination between the cognitive control network, which is involved in executive functions such as planning and problem-solving, and the default mode network, which is most active during mind-wandering or daydreaming (Beaty, R. E., et al., Cerebral Cortex, Vol. 31, No. 10, 2021). The cooperation of those networks may be a unique feature of creativity, Green said. “These two systems are usually antagonistic. They rarely work together, but creativity seems to be one instance where they do.”

Green has also found evidence that an area called the frontopolar cortex, in the brain’s frontal lobes, is associated with creative thinking. And stimulating the area seems to boost creative abilities. He and his colleagues used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate the frontopolar cortex of participants as they tried to come up with novel analogies. Stimulating the area led participants to make analogies that were more semantically distant from one another—in other words, more creative (Cerebral Cortex, Vol. 27, No. 4, 2017).

Green’s work suggests that targeting specific areas in the brain, either with neuromodulation or cognitive interventions, could enhance creativity. Yet no one is suggesting that a single brain region, or even a single neural network, is responsible for creative thought. “Creativity is not one system but many different mechanisms that, under ideal circumstances, work together in a seamless way,” Kounios said.

In search of the eureka moment
Creativity looks different from person to person. And even within one brain, there are different routes to a creative spark, Kounios explained. One involves what cognitive scientists call “System 1” (also called “Type 1”) processes: quick, unconscious thoughts—aha moments—that burst into consciousness. A second route involves “System 2” processes: thinking that is slow, deliberate, and conscious. “Creativity can use one or the other or a combination of the two,” he said. “You might use Type 1 thinking to generate ideas and Type 2 to critique and refine them.”

Which pathway a person uses might depend, in part, on their expertise. Kounios and his colleagues used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine what was happening in jazz musicians’ brains as they improvised on the piano. Then skilled jazz instructors rated those improvisations for creativity, and the researchers compared each musician’s most creative compositions. They found that for highly experienced musicians, the mechanisms used to generate creative ideas were largely automatic and unconscious, and they came from the left posterior part of the brain. Less-experienced pianists drew on more analytical, deliberative brain processes in the right frontal region to devise creative melodies, as Kounios and colleagues described in a special issue of NeuroImage on the neuroscience of creativity (Vol. 213, 2020). “It seems there are at least two pathways to get from where you are to a creative idea,” he said.

From Dashiel Carrera, Matthew Vollmer, Matthew Tomkinson, Julie Carr, and Jean Marc Ah-Sen
By Dashiel Carrera
September 12, 2022
I have long been an anxious writer. Every sentence written reminds me of the hundreds more that could have stood in its place, missed opportunities for assonance or characterization, clauses left dependent that could have—should have—been made independent. Often it takes all the perseverance I can muster not to leap up and gaze out the window, or better yet, flip open a book by somebody who’s already figured it all out.

For me, the anxiety of writing is the anxiety of possibility. Musical performance—despite all its lore of stage-fright, jitters, and choking—has been my salvation. When performing in front of an audience, a wrong note can’t be taken back; the audience hears it immediately. I find this precariousness strangely freeing. Rather than obsessing over what was previously played, I’m forced to move forward, adapt, and accept my failings. Mistakes become opportunities; a wrong note may suddenly evoke some new cluster of tones I wouldn’t have found otherwise, or veer a solo into provocative territory.

When I began composing The Deer (Dalkey Archive Press), I started to think of my writing sessions as a form of musical performance. I began each session with a clock next to me, forcing myself to hit a word count before the alarm buzzed. The incredible pressure of this process no doubt influenced the mental state of The Deer’s protagonist—panicked, confused, full of dread—but his voice was able to take on an independence and agency I wouldn’t have otherwise thought possible. Without the time to go back and tinker with the language as I wrote, I began to “play” the narrator’s voice like I might a musical instrument, guiding his focus but leaving the idiosyncratic timbre and cadence of his voice intact. Adding a time constraint helped me step out of my own way and give The Deer’s narrator room to breathe.

Because I had such luck using creative constraints, the past few months I’ve been learning more about their history. In literature, creative constraints are often self-imposed. Novels are written without the letter “e,” literary works are written to read the same backwards as forwards, and poems are written such that they can be rearranged into billions of possible permutations. More recently I’ve been talking with other contemporary writers who use constraints, and discovered that what constitutes a constraint is often more ambiguous than in these classic examples. I was asked: doesn’t every artistic process involve constraints? Aren’t we constrained by our responsibilities, our limited energies, and the finite words in the English language?

“I am often drawn to constraint-based approaches for this very reason: namely, because they give something back.”
For writers, it may be the case that the magic of creative constraints doesn’t lie in the constraints themselves but in the ways in which they counteract some deleterious impulse. The creative constraint may also be a means of helping writers understand the wants and needs of a particular project. Certainly for the five projects in this collection—spanning the genres of fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction—creative constraints elucidated the shifting boundaries that circumscribed the writing process, and revealed a path forward.

Matthew Vollmer, Inscriptions for Headstones
(Outpost 19)

So about ten years ago I realized that, in the same way that an art teacher might give her students specific assignments, like “paint that bowl of fruit” or “draw an abstraction of a nude body” or “try to produce a photorealistic rendering of a spilled glass of orange juice,” I too could ask my students to write specific and formally innovative writing exercises, like “write a story in the form of a monologue” or “write a story in second person” or “write a story in first person plural” or “write a story in the form of instructions” or “write a story in the form of an epitaph,” the latter of which inspired me to imagine how subverting that particular form would require a writer to make decisions about retaining the epitaph’s distinctive conventions or not, and so with this in mind, I decided to write multiple epitaphs (instead of just one) from a third person perspective and to begin each epitaph with a phrase that would signal to the reader that we were undoubtedly in epitaph territory, like “here lies X” or “R.I.P. Y” or “this stone marks the final resting place of Z,” and instead of preserving the inherently pithy quality of the form, which often seemed to relay only the most basic of information regarding the deceased—like “beloved father and husband”—I chose to write a number of very long-winded and serpentine epitaphs that announced and then explored something idiosyncratic about myself—for example, “here lies a man who wasn’t always nice to his son” or “here lies a man who didn’t always want to take his dog for a walk” or “here lies a man who as a child used to like to imagine when he was in the shower that he was one of the humans who’d declined an invitation into Noah’s Ark and was therefore hours away from being overtaken by floodwaters”—and then afterwards kind of allowed each narrative to cascade and wander and digress until it found a place to land, and so in this way I generated epitaph after epitaph for myself, each one unfolding in a single sentence, a limitation that was quite liberating and proved—to me anyway—that it was true what painter David Hockney once said, which was that, “if you were told to make a drawing of a tulip using five lines or one using a hundred, you’d be more inventive with the five,” an aphorism I find myself often repeating, because I wholeheartedly believe that whatever artistic constraints you as a writer decide to assign yourself or your students—like, say, write a really long sentence—you will reap benefits and be surprised, and if you doubt me try it for yourself and see.

oems

Matthew Tomkinson, oems
(Guernica Editions)

My forthcoming poetry collection, oems, is something of an exercise in data management. Before writing anything, I first resolved to flatten the dictionary. This entailed copy-pasting the contents of the Merriam Webster into a spreadsheet, and then removing all words containing tall letters (b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, q, t, y). What remained was a curated list of flat words such as “sunrise” and “consciousness,” with which I composed the book. In essence, then, my chosen form fits the definition of a lipogram (a work that omits certain letters).

For a long time, I wrote under this constraint without knowing whether it had an official name. Before the industrial era of spreadsheets, I would sit with my friend Geoffrey D. Morrison and try to spontaneously brainstorm a list of flat words, or “smooths,” as we called them then. Some of these early experiments appear in our collaborative book of short fiction, Archaic Torso of Gumby. For the new book, I have sculpted a series of thirty-six flattened poems, whose language veers at times toward jargon (“excimer ions”) and, frequently, toward irreverent humor (“minnie mouse on ice”). Meanwhile, the lipogrammatic imagination seems to inevitably drift, like a river tube rental group, toward “waves,” “oceans,” “seas,” and so on. One of the more freeing aspects of my process was the use of chance operations (spreadsheet formulas) to generate random combinations of flat words, which would help steer the poems in unexpected directions. In one instance, for example, I was greeted by the phrase “anurous caiman,” and the image of a tailless lizard seemed rather fitting for a book that eschews typographical tails.

I am often drawn to constraint-based approaches for this very reason: namely, because they give something back. They provide a certain level of texture against which a metaphorical match can more easily be struck. Moreover, they tend to save me from the unnameable pain of waiting to have an idea. The “prisoner’s constraint,” as the Oulipian writer Paul Fournel calls it, is based on the idea that a resourceful inmate might use flat words in order to fit more of them onto a small scrap of paper. But this analogy strikes me as needlessly oppressive, utilitarian. Indeed, one of the personal subtexts throughout the book is my attempt to transfigure OCD by leaning into formal fixations (so-called “monomania”) and to ultimately unsee this condition as a kind of mental prison, but instead: a conceptual playground.

real life

Julie Carr, Real Life: An Installation
(Omnidawn)

I write, I think, for maximal freedom, maximal movement. But the body is constrained by its own borders: its form, its skin, its genre. Being in a body, being in a genre, is so often about wanting out. How can I be other than I seem to myself? Other than I seem to others? How can I write beyond the borders of the page, the borders of my language, of my imagination? I used to dance and wish I had more limbs, softer joints, that my front would be my back and my inside my out. But the only way to get to the ecstasy of exceeding oneself was, paradoxically, by constraining oneself. Give the body a task, a pattern to repeat (in dance, as in writing, this is called a “phrase”).

Repetition becomes a form of deep study, as one discovers the seemingly infinite room within the room the rules make. “The islands feel the enclasping flow, / And then their endless bounds they know,” the Victorian poet Matthew Arnold wro in a poem called “To Marguerite—Continued.” Here the island, as a metaphor for the body, knows its own limits when it is constrained, “enclasped,” by an external entity, an “order” or a “rule” (Arnold uses both these words in the next stanza). And yet, Arnold is punning. The word “bound,” when a verb, means to leap, maybe to leap across, to move with energy and freedom. The very same force that creates a boundary also allows for endless movement.

When I was writing a book with a maximalist impulse, Real Life: An Installation, I would sometimes find myself paralyzed by too much freedom. I’d given myself some rules to write by, but because I wanted the writing to stay as close to the chaos of “real life” as possible, the rules were loose, the boundaries wide. One day in a moment of confusion, I fund myself numbering my lines. When I got to fourteen, the number of lines in a sonnet, I stopped. I titled the poem “Into it,” for it had allowed me back “in” to the writing. I found that within the cool comfort of the 14-line limit, I could pack almost anything I wanted. Like a child in a playground, the poem felt protected, even as it went wild. “The real renews itself each year/ I’ll do whatever the radios suggest,” I wrote in lines numbered 4 and 5. After that, I wrote dozens of fourteen-line poems, each with their lines deliberately numbered. Propulsive motion had a clearly demarked beginning and end; “enclasped” by counting, my language, by which I mean my body, could once again move.

Disintegration in Four Parts

Jean Marc Ah-Sen, Disintegration in Four Parts
(Coach House Books)

Disintegration in Four Parts was a “collaborative omnibus novel” I put together with fellow Canadian novelists Lee Henderson, Emily Anglin, and Devon Code. I had quit writing as a professional activity in 2016, but I came out of “retirement” for a story collection called In the Beggarly Style of Imitation. I felt burned out but pressured to follow it up quickly. I was thinking a novella might be the best solution, but I was worried about the market hostility to an otherwise creatively fertile form.

I found the solution to my problem in Ro.Go.Pa.G., the anthology film Roberto Rossellini, Jean-Luc Godard, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Ugo Gregoretti produced together in 1963. I wondered if I could borrow this arrangement and half-jokingly spearhead a “CanLit supergroup.” Like the film, the book would be collaborative, but also betoken a persevering individualism and unity of vision. I wanted to ape the film’s boundary-testing éclat and see if a voyage to the edge could finally dock in the liminal spaces between novel, novella, and anthology.

I came up with a quote that could rally potential writers together—“all purity is created by resemblance and disavowal”—and then sought out the best literary fiction practitioners I knew to interpret the cryptic dictum. We individually abided by a 10,000 word count and an ambitious four month deadline. These constraints were really on account of my unfledged status in writing. I thought I could turn this project into a “clinker-built” writing apprenticeship for myself, where my work could somehow overlap with others and participate in the rigors of a creative writing program. My writing is for the most part improvisational and aleatory, but the quote and word count helped bring focus to my efforts—it pushed me to ensure that each sentence pointilistically contributed to the theme I forced us to tackle. In this respect, my piece became less character-driven and more symbolically oriented, for better or for worse.

Having access to Lee, Emily, and Devon’s processes was a blessing, in part because we were accountable to each other—writer’s block becomes less of a problem when someone is depending on you to finish a story so that you can start pitching a book together, which was exactly the kind of dogged motivation I needed to ensure I would not abandon writing a second time.";Five Writers opinion on benefit of writing constraints;"- **Creative Constraints:** ✍️ Writers like **Dashiel Carrera** and **Matthew Vollmer** highlight how imposing limits can spark creativity and focus.

Level Up: The Evolution of Video Game Music
Technology has come a long way in the last 40+ years, so let’s take a trip down memory lane to learn how video game music was made and how far it has progressed. You’ll hear from some of the top names in the industry as they share their take on the current and future state of gaming music!

“One of the things that is so special about video games is you could say that you achieved something that you know there was a goal, and you were able to conquer a goal and be rewarded for that. This is something that is so great about computer games that it just doesn’t exist in other media.” – Inon Zur

In the Beginning
Back in 1978, the classic game Space Invaders was introduced to arcades worldwide. While earlier consoles could produce sound in one way or another, Space Invaders was the first video game with a continuous “soundtrack,” which was groundbreaking then. While there was nothing wrong with hearing the iconic blips of the 1972 classic Pong, Space Invaders set the tone for where video game music would end up.

Early games like Space Invaders used the Texas Instruments SN76477 complex sound generator. The SN76477 was a noise-generator chip that consisted of a noise generator, VCO, super-low-frequency oscillator (SLF oscillator), a mixer, noise filter, A/D circuitry, audio amplifier, and control circuitry. Someone could use all this to create noise, sounds, tones, or a combination. Programmers used this chip in many arcade games and clocks. And, with some circuitry knowledge, you could (and still can) even create a synthesizer!

What About Actual Music?
You might be saying: “Space Invaders didn’t have any music. It was just noises,” and, yes, you’d be correct. While Space Invaders has the title of the first continuous “soundtrack,” the distinction is continuous sound — notmusic. Rally-X, an arcade game released in 1980, holds the distinction of the first continuous melodic soundtrack. Instead of using the sound generator like previous arcade games, Rally-X was the first known game to use a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to produce sampled tones.


RALLY X (1980 Namco)
8-bit Revolution
Fast-forward a few years, and the 8-bit revolution begins. No longer were there simple beeps on a one-channel sound chip. Developers could now compose soundtracks on a more advanced programmable sound generator (PSG). This revolution laid the groundwork not only in the gaming world but for a popular way of creating music in the future, aptly called “chiptune.”

No matter what platform you used back in the stone age of video games, you needed a great understanding of circuitry to program video game music. However, thanks to modern technology, you can re-create the sounds of old using virtual instruments like UVI’s 8-Bit Synth and Vengeance-Sound’s 8-bit Era!

NES (Nintendo)
1985 saw the release of arguably the most iconic console game of all time: Super Mario Bros. While plenty of games were released before that, it’s widely accepted that it’s one of the most, if not the most, famous video game soundtracks of all time. Unlike previous video game systems that used the TI SN76477 as a sound generator, Nintendo used a Ricoh 2A03 (NTSC version)/Ricoh 2A07 (PAL version) for creating music.

The 2A03 consisted of five mono channels that could only produce the following sounds: two pulse waves, one triangle wave, one noise generator, and one DPCM channel, which was allocated to samples but was very rarely used. Due to Ricoh’s restrictions, programmers were stuck with those five sounds. That explains why most NES music sounded the same — catchy but very primitive.

The Commodore 64 (C64) used the MOS 6581 SID (sound interface device) chip. Although it only had three mono audio channels, each channel could produce a triangle, pulse, sawtooth, or noise waveform or any variation of the four waveforms.

What made C64 soundtracks more interesting was that programmers figured out how to “hack” the chips to reassign waveforms on a channel at any time, allowing the programmers to write more complex pieces with fewer limitations. Here are oscilloscope traces of the M.U.L.E. and Commando soundtracks to better understand how the chip worked “before the hack” and “after the hack.” In M.U.L.E., you can see it only uses square, saw, and noise waveforms. On the Commando soundtrack, however, you can see how noise waveforms were reassigned as square waves on the same channel on the fly.

Despite what you’ve heard, the word “imagineering” is not unique to Disney. In fact, it’s a phrase that was first used in World War II corporate propaganda.

Today in Tedium: When I write the word “imagineering,” what does it mean to you? Does it make you think of a certain company or concept? Is that company or concept perhaps something related to a cartoon or a theme park? Yes, yes, I get it, the primary company that uses this phrase is culturally dominant—but what if I told you that Disney, despite using the word “imagineering” in an aggressive way for decades to describe its approach to innovation, didn’t actually come up with this term, and that other companies used it for years before Disney got around to trademarking the phrase? That’s imagineering for you. And today’s Tedium looks back at a term that one of the world’s largest companies has long claimed to have coined, even in the face of years of prior art. — Ernie @ Tedium

“We’re always exploring and experimenting. At WED, we call it Imagineering—the blending of creative imagination with technical know-how.”
— Walt Disney, explaining the way that his company’s R&D firm, WED Enterprises, later known as Walt Disney Imagineering, came across the term that is very closely associated with the Disney brand today. The company, which was founded to oversee the creation of Disneyland, remains one of the key parts of the Disney empire.

Imagineering Alcoa Ad
One of Alcoa’s many ads promoting “imagineering,” a concept it embraced nearly two decades before Disney did. Some of the ads took a feel much closer to propaganda. (Internet Archive)
Imagineering started as a wartime slogan for the aluminum industry to promote itself, with no Disney in sight
During the third week of November, 1942, a full-page ad, published by the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa), was published in a number of big-city newspapers in an effort to encourage the purchase of war bonds by the public.

The ad, which I will not reprint in full because it includes a clear racist caricature, features an editorial cartoon of a solder firing a large mounted weapon at Hitler and a Japanese soldier. The weapon’s rounds are being fed into the gun in the form of war bonds. And the soldier, in a facial expression that implies screaming at the top of his lungs, says, in large, chunky block script letters, “PRAISE THE LORD AND PASS THE AMMUNITION!”

This editorial cartoon takes up half the page. But below the text is a discussion about buying war bonds, as well as what aluminum is good for, along with a discussion about why imagineering matters:

How To Buy Your Tomorrow Today
Far-sighted people who buy War Bonds today will have the money tomorrow with which to buy the products of industry’s Imagineering*: the revolutionary new automobiles; the new comfortable homes; the labor-saving household appliances; the new and improved aluminum cooking utensils; the television radios and all the flood of other things that war-sharpened inventiveness will throw open to us.

Right now Alcoa’s Imagineering is devoted to producing aluminum that will help American planes fly faster, farther and higher than anything the enemy possesses … but the marvelous production of aluminum for war (nearly 7 times that of peacetime America) and the four war-time price reductions on aluminum, arc among the things which are helping de-signers, architects, engineers to do the Imagineering that will make many of these things possible.

The pent-up demand for all these things will create the post-war market that will make jobs for our boys when they come home. The money which you and millions of other Americans are putting into War Bonds will then become the cash-in-pocket with which to buy the things everyone will want in peace. War Savings Bonds are backed by the U. S. Government. They are the safest place you can put your money. A War Bond is a Government Savings Account that pays you interest. Buy War Bonds regularly to save for the things you will want tomorrow. Buy Your Tomorrow Today.

Below this text is this definition of imagineering, a term Alcoa is clearly proud of:

Imagineering: a word coined by Alcoa from imagination and engineering; the art of planning today the things you will want tomorrow.

And to be clear, this was not like a small marketing term for this company. It was the center of a major campaign by the aluminum industry to ensure that the American people knew that aluminum, despite being hard to come by during the war effort, aluminum was there, doing important work for the American public.

Imagineering Sky Hook
Imagineering: a kind of sky hook. (Internet Archive)
This word wasn’t a minor discussion point for the aluminum industry: It was literally at the center of their entire wartime marketing campaign. In the months before the word appeared in major newspapers with racially tinged wartime propaganda, it appeared in ads for industry publications like Manufacturers Record, Forbes, and The Cornell Engineer. An ad in the latter makes it clear that this term was a Eureka moment for the company.

“For a long time we’ve sought a word to describe what we all work at hard here at Alcoa,” the ad states, before further adding: “Imagineering is the word.”

(And there’s even evidence that imagineering predates the Alcoa ad campaign; a 1920 humor column in the Automobile Trade Journal refers to an “Imagineer” as “the man who thought he knew more than the car designer.”)

It’s strange that a term that appears to have been very strongly associated with the aluminum industry seems to have been co-opted so completely by an entertainment company, especially given the fact that there are signs that it had gained currency as an inventive phrase not long after Alcoa pushed it out into the world.

“Thus we have come to realize that upon imagination, civilization has developed. It is the eye of faith, and the essence of personality,” wrote Lee S. Trimble, an executive officer with the Macon, Georgia, chamber of commerce, in a 1943 op-ed. “Please allow the new word imagineering, as descriptive of the method by which worthy methods are made practical and serviceable.”

Trimble got his wish. But he might be surprised to know that said wish was commandeered primarily by a single company.";Social Imagineering;"- **Definition of Imagineering:** ️ Imagineering is the blend of **imagination** and **engineering**.

I think that a key way to highlight that Disney’s heavy use of this word isn’t unique to them is to highlight the fact that people have written books driven in large part by the phrase, which each having a unique twist to how they think of the word—in some ways, very different to how Disney uses it internally.

So, with that in mind, here’s the list.

The 1980 educational reference book Imagineering the Reading Process: A Complete Multisensory Approach to Reading, by Michele Borba and Dan Ungaro, dives into a style of teaching reading that emphasizes associating words with experiences, say using actual mud to teach the word mud.
The 1981 self-help book Imagineering for Health, by Serge King, makes the case that utilizing your imagination is an effective way to deal with mental health issues, something the author says he has based on 30 years of research.
The 1986 self-help book Imagineering: How to Profit from Your Creative Powers, by Michael LeBoeuf, goes out of its way to extend Alcoa’s ideas to any sort of creative ingenuity. In case you need a creative spark that only a book that predates the internet can offer, this might be your ticket.
The 1996 urban renewal book Imagineering Atlanta: The Politics of Place in the City of Dreams, by Charles Rutheiser, makes a strong case for reimagining the future of the South’s cultural center.
The 1998 library science book Information Imagineering, published by the American Library Association, focuses on the role of digital research in finding information.
“Some passages in Imagineering sound like Mao: ‘We realize in order for our dreams to come true, change must be welcomed.’”
— New York magazine writer Walter Kirn, reviewing Walt Disney Imagineering, a behind-the-scenes coffee table book that focuses on Disney’s approach to creation. Kirn portrays the book as discussing a corporate religion. “The whole thing provokes in many a deep hostility—particularly in what used to be called leftist intellectuals,” Kirn continued. “And no wonder. Imagineering makes it plain that what Stalin only promised, Disney (at least in miniature) delivered.”

How Walt Disney’s R&D arm embraced and co-opted the imagineering buzzword
Over Disney’s history, the company has been quite good at documenting itself and its approach to creativity, in a way that many other companies are not. The use of documentary footage, in many ways, has likely helped to create a sort of aura around the decisions the company makes in a way that I’d probably compare most to Apple.

Play
In 2019, for example, director Leslie Iwerks (granddaughter of Disney legend Ub Iwerks) directed a film for the company about its Imagineering practice, which is currently available on Disney+. It suggests imagineering is a massive cultural force that drives forward its theme filmmaking and theme park efforts, that there is something truly special and unique about someone who can cut it as an Imagineer.

But it’s perhaps an earlier film that hangs deeper over the Disney influence on the imagineering concept.

Play
The film, discussing Disney’s “Florida Project” that was part aspiration, part Disney World, highlights the way that the company’s research and development arm, WED, had shaped its approach to theme park design and overall creativity.

Filmed in 1966, the documentary is one of the last films Walt Disney ever made, and in it, the company’s approach to imagineering is emphasized. At one point, the narrator says this:

What WED does is called Imagineering—the blending of creative imagination with technical know-how. The talents of WED have gone to work outside Disneyland, too. At the New York World’s Fair, four of the most popular attractions where Disney shows and corporate exhibits that skillfully welcomed and entertained more than 150,000 people every day.

Lots of companies have R&D departments, which help them find new ways to innovate. What Disney did that helped it stand apart was to turn it into a proprietary artform, something that no other company can quite perfect.

The idea, implied by the unique language, is that nobody can do imagineering quite like Disney. Anything else is mimicry. And perhaps it is. But despite Disney owning a trademark on the term, which it registered in the late 1980s, the prior art is strong for this specific phrase.

The whimsy and power of imagineering clearly existed in the aluminum industry at least 20 years before the term was first used in the press—the first reference I can find of Disney, specifically, using it is 1963, when an associate said this of the Disney approach to creativity:

“Walt Disney is involved in every operation of every show,” an associate reports.

“He approves the ideas, the scripts, and everything else. You can’t call this a one-man operation—hardly, with 900 employees working here in the studio.

“But we’re all guided by Walt’s ideas and vision: good taste, imagination, and creativity. A man who worked for him years ago summed it up perfectly. He made up a word.

“He called it imagineering, and it’s applicable.”

Did the unknown person see the ads by the aluminum industry, published during wartime as the industry looked to maintain is presence in the business discussion even as its product was being used elsewhere? Or was it, as posited by author Richard Snow, brought into WED’s culture by Union Carbide in the 1950s?

Is imagineering Disney’s way of holding onto the spirit of Walt in some small way, even 55 years after his death? Perhaps it is. Perhaps that’s why it has remained as a part of the company’s culture decades after the term found its way into an article about the cult of Disney.

But one thing it is not is a concept unique to Disney.

Even today, imagineering, while heavily associated with Disney, isn’t owned solely by them. Not even close.

For example, a company called Imagineering, Inc., a manufactures printed circuit boards, while another legacy company called Imagineering from the ’80s and early ’90s—when the imagineering language really kicked off at Disney—developed video games for various platforms of the era, as a subsidiary of Absolute Entertainment. Another video game developer, named Imagineer, has been active in Japan since 1986.

A British foundation called Imagineering teaches about STEM, while a company named Imagineer Systems, for years, sold visual effects software, basically creating a deep overlap on Disney’s home turf before it was sold off around 2014. Another company Called Intergraph sold CAD software under the Imagineer name during the early ’90s.

Play
And, on top of all that, a Scottish indie rock band with no discernible Disney influence called The Imagineers has been going strong since 2010. They even have a song called Imagineer, in case you think this post needs a soundtrack.

I guess what I’m getting at is the fact that, for some reason, we have let a megacorp dominate what is effectively a buzzword, a fancy way of saying “brainstorm,” for decades, for no reason other than a corporate belief that Disney coined or deeply embraced it, and it defines a way that the company thinks about the process of creation.

Polar Express
Imagineering involving a popular animated property that has nothing to do with Disney. (via Lionel)
And despite its domination of this phrase, it has essentially failed to prevent others from using it, leading to fun situations such as the model train company Lionel making a Polar Express set under its Imagineering brand of toy trains, despite the fact that The Polar Express is a Warner Bros. IP.

As I’ve said in the past, Disney has had some questionable stances on the role of ownership and intellectual property in a modern society, which is why, in my view, it’s fair to critique things like this. Here is a term that was used for at least two decades by another company, and then Disney came in and slowly turned it into a key part of their corporate culture, to the point that it dominates search terms for the phrase.

Sure, you can have your corporate culture, but let’s be clear here—there’s no reason Disney needed to imagineer its way into dominating the way we talk about imagineering. Big aluminum was there way earlier.

I wonder if it grinds Disney’s gears that there are so many other examples of imagineering out there.

Imagine being able to hear, feel and think – but not see or move. Around you, you can hear doctors and family members saying that you cannot understand or make decisions.

This nightmare scenario is a reality for tens of thousands of people worldwide who have been diagnosed as being in a coma but can, in reality, understand what is going on around them.

A new, experimental technology has enabled a woman in Sicily, Italy, living with locked-in syndrome to successfully communicate with her family after years of silence.

‘The family was unsure if she was still there,’ said Dr Christoph Guger, the founder of the Austrian company behind the device, known as mindBeagle. ‘They had seen no sign of consciousness for so long.’

The technology, developed under the EU-funded ComaWare project, is shaped into a soft cap and is packed with electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes that measure brain activity.

As scientists learn more about comas, it has become clear that there are various states of consciousness along the spectrum from being in a coma to having normal brain function.

Conscious

‘Coma patients can be subdivided into several types,’ said Dr Guger. ‘People who are genuinely in a coma have no cognitive function and no motor responses – they cannot think and they cannot move. But some people may appear to be in a coma even though they are in fact conscious to some degree.’

“
‘Some people may appear to be in a coma even though they are in fact conscious to some degree.’

Dr Christoph Guger, Chief Executive, Guger Technologies
Differentiating patients who are in a coma from those in a minimally conscious state is a major challenge. To the naked eye, they all appear unresponsive. ‘The lack of feedback from the patient makes it exceedingly difficult to judge,’ said Dr Guger.

The standard tests to assess patients who appear to be unconscious are not always accurate, he adds. People who show no motor function are usually assessed once early in their illness, and that diagnosis informs their treatment for months or years to come.

Researchers now know that in patients who appear unconscious but are in fact aware, states of alertness may fluctuate during the day. This means that someone could be misdiagnosed as being in a coma even though for much of the day their brain is active.

Dr Guger explained: ‘mindBeagle first figures out whether the patient has any cognitive function and can understand what is going on around them. If they still have cognitive function we can communicate with people affected by locked-in syndrome by asking yes/no questions and gauging their response by monitoring brain activity.’

The system has a number of features. A simple auditory test assesses the patient’s capacity for hearing and understanding. By playing high- and low-pitched tones, instructing the patient to count only the high tones and then measuring brain waves, doctors can learn whether their apparently comatose patient is in fact tuned into their environment.

‘The EEG data picks up whether the patient can hear and distinguish between high and low tones,’ Dr Guger said, noting that the test can be repeated at different times of the day to test whether the patient is particularly alert at certain times.

The system also uses tactile stimulation to check awareness and ask patients to answer questions. By stimulating the left or right hand, for example, patients can be asked to focus on the side of their body that is vibrating. By measuring brain activity, scientists can tell whether the subject is successfully responding to vibrations.

Communication mode

‘This is also the communication mode,’ says Dr Guger. ‘We can ask them to imagine moving their left or right hand. We then observe changes in the sensory motor cortex (which controls movement).’

If a patient is asked a question and told that moving their left hand means ‘yes’, while moving the right hand means ‘no’, they are able to respond by thinking about moving the appropriate hand. Although they may not actually move a muscle, the mindBeagle wearable EEG device effectively reads their thoughts.

The device is also being used in a Harvard-linked hospital in the US to assess unconscious patients admitted to the emergency department, and a university in Oregon is testing the system for use in locked-in patients.

Meanwhile a hospital in Liege, Belgium, uses mindBeagle to differentiate between various stages of consciousness, helping doctors to separate patients with locked-in syndrome from those in a permanent vegetative state.

In future, the approach could be used to help paralysed people to communicate and in the rehabilitation of stroke victims.

Mobile diagnosis

Wearable EEG systems also promise to revolutionise epilepsy care. Around 65 million people worldwide live with epilepsy, which is usually diagnosed by a specialist reading an EEG scan which lasts around 20 minutes.

Patients are often prescribed medication and asked to keep a diary which can later be reviewed with their doctor. ‘If the first drug is not working, they change it and repeat the process, which takes a lot of time,’ said Professor Esther Rodriguez-Villegas of Imperial College London, UK.

However, she believes this short assessment does not always collect enough information about the patient’s brain. If a longer EEG could be offered more frequently it could provide doctors with more information, making it easier to manage epilepsy with medication.

She said: ‘20 minutes is not always enough time to figure out what is going on. However, EEG requires access to specialist equipment and staff so it’s a catch-22 because time and resources are limited.’

The solution is to develop a simple, lightweight version of EEG that patients can wear for longer periods, allowing doctors to collect the most pertinent data on their brain in various states – including during epileptic seizures.

Through the WEEG project, funded by the EU's European Research Council (ERC), Prof. Rodriguez-Villegas has developed a device that balances the desire for a wearable solution with the need for sufficient battery life to last several hours.

Under a hat

‘The whole idea is to make something that’s small enough to be worn under a hat – or even integrated into a hat – and is light enough to wear while walking around during the day,’ she explained. ‘The reason existing EEG machines are so big is that they are heavy on power consumption so that was the challenge we needed to overcome.’

The solution lay in microchips with integrated circuits that consume less power than a single neuron in the brain. This means a very small, long-life battery is enough to power the system without adding weight.

The device uses novel algorithms and collects data which can be viewed in real time, but Prof. Rodriguez-Villegas believes a health professional will still be required to interpret the information. ‘Fully automated diagnosis would be a big challenge, so doctors are still part of the picture for diagnosing epilepsy.’

The next step for the wearable EEG is to explore its potential in monitoring the brainwaves of people with sleep disorders. Prof. Rodriguez-Villegas has won a new ERC grant to develop a consumer product which could be worn overnight. If her proof-of-concept research is successful, it could deliver a nightcap that serves data for breakfast.";Does coma patient brain still working?;"- **Brainwave Scanners:**  These devices can help understand the thoughts of **coma patients** who seem unresponsive but may be aware.

Prolonged social isolation can do severe, long-lasting damage to the brain 

By Dana G. Smith

Neuroscience
SAN DIEGO—Robert King spent 29 years living alone in a six by nine-foot prison cell.

He was part of the “Angola Three”—a trio of men kept in solitary confinement for decades and named for the Louisiana state penitentiary where they were held. King was released in 2001 after a judge overturned his 1973 conviction for killing a fellow inmate. Since his exoneration he has dedicated his life to raising awareness about the psychological harms of solitary confinement.

“People want to know whether or not I have psychological problems, whether or not I’m crazy—‘How did you not go insane?’” King told a packed session at the annual Society for Neuroscience meeting here this week. “I look at them and I tell them, ‘I did not tell you I was not insane.’ I don’t mean I was psychotic or anything like that, but being placed in a six by nine by 12–foot cell for 23 hours a day, no matter how you appear on the outside, you are not sane.”

There are an estimated 80,000 people, mostly men, in solitary confinement in U.S. prisons. They are confined to windowless cells roughly the size of a king bed for 23 hours a day, with virtually no human contact except for brief interactions with prison guards. According to scientists speaking at the conference session, this type of social isolation and sensory deprivation can have traumatic effects on the brain, many of which may be irreversible. Neuroscientists, lawyers and activists such as King have teamed up with the goal of abolishing solitary confinement as cruel and unusual punishment.

Most prisoners sentenced to solitary confinement remain there for one to three months (pdf), although nearly a quarter spend over a year there; the minimum amount of time is usually 15 days. The most common reasons for being sent to solitary are for preventive measures, which can be indefinite, or for punishment, which is more likely to have a set end point. Several states have passed legislation limiting who can be in solitary confinement, including mentally ill and juvenile offenders, and for how long. The United Nations recommends banning solitary confinement for more than 15 days, saying any longer constitutes torture.

Even in less extreme cases than that of the Angola Three, prolonged social isolation—feeling lonely, not just being alone—can exact severe physical, emotional and cognitive consequences. It is associated with a 26 percent increased risk of premature death, largely stemming from an out of control stress response that results in higher cortisol levels, increased blood pressure and inflammation. Feeling socially isolated also increases the risk of suicide. “We see solitary confinement as nothing less than a death penalty by social deprivation,” said Stephanie Cacioppo, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago, who was on the panel with King.

Solitary Confinement Is Cruel and Ineffective
The Editors

For good or bad, the brain is shaped by its environment—and the social isolation and sensory deprivation King experienced likely changed his. Chronic stress damages the hippocampus, a brain area important for memory, spatial orientation and emotion regulation. As a result, socially isolated people experience memory loss, cognitive decline and depression. Studies show depression results in additional cell death in the hippocampus as well as the loss of a growth factor that has antidepressant-like properties, creating a vicious cycle. When sensory deprivation and an absence of natural light are thrown into the mix, people can experience psychosis and disruptions in the genes that control the body’s natural circadian rhythms. “Social deprivation is bad for brain structure and function. Sensory deprivation is bad for brain structure and function. Circadian dysregulation is bad,” said Huda Akil, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Michigan who was also on the panel. “Loneliness in itself is extremely damaging.”

King has experienced lasting cognitive changes from his time in solitary confinement. His memory is impaired and he has lost his ability to navigate, both of which are signs of damage to the hippocampus. At one point he was unable to recognize faces, but that problem has passed. Cacioppo speculated that social areas of his brain that were not being used, like those involved in facial recognition, might have atrophied during his time in solitary. Supporting this idea, recent research conducted in mice by neuroscientist Richard Smeyne at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia and presented at the conference revealed that after one month of social isolation, neurons in sensory and motor regions of the brain had shrunk by 20 percent.

The question remains as to whether these neuronal changes are permanent or can be reversed. Akil said, however, she doubts “you can live through that experience and come out with the same brain you went in with, and not in a good way.”

King said he survived the ordeal because he recognized that his case was “politicized,” and bigger than himself. He and many supporters believe the Angola Three were targeted and falsely convicted because they were members of the Black Panther party. Their cases were later taken up by the United Nations as an example of the inhumanity of solitary confinement. According to Cacioppo, King’s connection to a larger group and larger purpose likely gave him the resilience to survive the ordeal. “Collective identity is protective against individual loneliness,” she noted.

By pairing their research with King’s experience, the neuroscientists on the panel hope to move the needle on people’s perspectives and policy around the issue. Jules Lobel, a professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh and the sole lawyer on the panel, thinks they can: Neuroscience research played a role in a class action lawsuit he won against solitary confinement in California. “Neuroscience can not only be a powerful tool for understanding the human condition,” he said, “but can also play an important role in changing the conditions that humans live under.”";Brain in isolation;"- **Solitary Confinement:**  A form of punishment where individuals are isolated in small cells for 23 hours a day.

AI can replicate human creativity in two key ways – but falls apart when asked to produce something truly new

Is computational creativity possible? The recent hype around generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, Dall-E and many others, raises new questions about whether creativity is a uniquely human skill. Some recent and remarkable milestones of generative AI foster this question:

An AI artwork, The Portrait of Edmond de Belamy, sold for $432,500, nearly 45 times its high estimate, by the auction house Christie’s in 2018. The artwork was created by a generative adversarial network that was fed a data set of 15,000 portraits covering six centuries.

Music producers such as Grammy-nominee Alex Da Kid, have collaborated with AI (in this case IBM’s Watson) to churn out hits and inform their creative process.

In the cases above, a human is still at the helm, curating the AI’s output according to their own vision and thereby retaining the authorship of the piece. Yet, AI image generator Dall-E, for example, can produce novel output on any theme you wish within seconds. Through diffusion, whereby huge datasets are scraped together to train the AI, generative AI tools can now transpose written phrases into novel pictures or improvise music in the style of any composer, devising new content that resembles the training data but isn’t identical. Authorship in this case is perhaps more complex. Is it the algorithm? The thousands of artists whose work has been scraped to produce the image? The prompter who successfully describes the style, reference, subject matter, lighting, point of view and even emotion evoked? To answer these questions, we must return to an age-old question.

What is creativity?
According to Margaret Boden, there are three types of creativity: combinational, exploratory, and transformational creativity. Combinational creativity combines familiar ideas together. Exploratory creativity generates new ideas by exploring ‘structured conceptual spaces,’ that is, tweaking an accepted style of thinking by exploring its contents, boundaries and potential. Both of these types of creativity are not a million miles from generative AI’s algorithmic production of art; creating novel works in the same style as millions of others in the training data, a ‘synthetic creativity.’ Transformational creativity, however, means generating ideas beyond existing structures and styles to create something entirely original; this is at the heart of current debates around AI in terms of fair use and copyright – very much unchartered legal waters, so we will have to wait and see what the courts decide.

The key characteristic of AI’s creative processes is that the current computational creativity is systematic, not impulsive, as its human counterpart can often be. It is programmed to process information in a certain way to achieve particular results predictably, albeit in often unexpected ways. In fact, this is perhaps the most significant difference between artists and AI: while artists are self- and product-driven, AI is very much consumer-centric and market-driven – we only get the art we ask for, which is not perhaps, what we need.

Understand how AI is changing society
So far, generative AI seems to work best with human partners and, perhaps then, the synthetic creativity of the AI is a catalyst to push our human creativity, augmenting human creativity rather than producing it. As is often the case, the hype around these tools as disruptive forces outstrips the reality. In fact, art history shows us that technology has rarely directly displaced humans from work they wanted to do. Think of the camera, for example, which was feared due to its power to put portrait painters out of business. What are the business implications for the use of synthetic creativity by AI, then?

Synthetic art for business
Synthetic creativity on demand, as currently generated by AI, is certainly a boon to business and marketing. Recent examples include:

AI-enhanced advertising: Ogilvy Paris used Dall-E to create an AI version of Vermeer’s The Milkmaid for Nestle yoghurts.

AI-designed furniture: Kartell, Philippe Starck and Autodesk collaborated with AI to create the first chair designed using AI for sustainable manufacturing.

AI-augmented fashion styling: Stitch Fix utilised AI to capture personalised visualisations of clothing based on requested customer preferences such as colour, fabric and style.

The potential use scenarios are endless and what they require is another form of creativity: curation. AI has been known to ‘hallucinate’ – an industry term for spewing nonsense – and the decidedly human skill required is in sense-making, that is expressing concepts, ideas and truths, rather than just something that is pleasing to the senses.

Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries
28 March 2024
Written by Ben Zhao, Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at University of Chicago
Ben Zhao, Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at University of Chicago
Since 2022, generative AI systems have made significant inroads into creative industries such as art, music and creative writing, areas long considered the exclusive domain of humans. Just in the realm of artistic imagery alone, human creatives have been replaced in significant numbers in industries ranging from graphics design, illustrations, to game design. Predictions of massive job loss have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024 across the entertainment industry, many of which are explicitly linked to use of AI. Today, court cases and public discourse debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent.

Generative AI models today use powerful machine learning algorithms to extract patterns from large volumes of popular content, to ""learn"" what is good art, what is good music, and what is compelling writing. If human tastes for art and creative content evolves over time, curated by stewards such as art critics and publishing editors, how do AI models do the same?  

One answer might be that generative AI can also find new art styles or the next new genre of popular music, by scanning and filtering all possible genres of music and art. This answer assumes that the space of possible artistic styles is finite and searchable. However, in my experiences developing and optimizing tools that explore and disrupt style mimicry, we find that the number of distinctive styles in art and music are nearly infinite. How will generative AI find the next version of hip-pop, a musical genre that has transformed the music industry and influenced genres as disparate as country music? Many historians trace the origin of Hip-pop to a mixture of black, latino and Caribbean youth in 1970s New York Bronx, protesting and expressing their rage and pain in a time of economic downward spiral. How would future AI models find ways to identify and transform that human condition into music, so that it can connect with other humans sharing similar emotions and experiences?

Part of this is because appreciation of music and other artistic mediums is subjective, and fundamentally based on human tastes. For an AI model to understand and predict how humans do or do not appreciate a specific style, it would have to first understand human emotions. Contrast this with other domains like software engineering, where success or failure is clearly defined, usually in a design document.

Taking this perspective, it is not hard to understand why current research predicts that AI models trained on their own input will eventually collapse. If each generation of a generative AI model is trying to approximate and mimic the complex human appreciation of an art form, then its output will be a facsimile with some amount of error. A model can reproduce the most popular styles with confidence, but much less so on the edges. With each iteration, the evolved model adds iteratively more error to the previous generation, moving further and further away from the ground truth that is subjective human standards.

Perhaps this provides the most compelling reason for why AI models must foster and protect human artists and creatives, regardless of how we feel about the ethics or legalities of generative AI training. If we allow generative AI to destroy human creative industries, by displacing jobs and discouraging aspiring artists, we are heading towards a future where art and music styles are fixed and static, and we are doomed to listen and see the same styles forever.";AI replace artists?;"- **Generative AI Impact:**  Since 2022, AI has entered creative fields like **art**, **music**, and **writing**, replacing many human artists.

A new study warns that AI models could collapse as they start increasingly relying on AI-generated content for training.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models could soon face a new problem as AI-generated content increasingly populates the Internet.

Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT have relied on data available online to train and improve their models.

However, as these models exhaust the available online data, or face increased restrictions on data access, they may train on AI-generated content.

This could result in a degradation of model performance, eventually leading to the production of gibberish content, a phenomenon referred to as “model collapse,” according to a new study.

“Overtime, we expect that it will get harder to train the models, even though we are likely to have more data, just because it's very easy to sample data from the models,” Ilia Shumailov, junior research fellow at the University of Oxford and co-author of the study, told Euronews Next.

“But what’s going to be happening is that it's going to be harder to find a population of data that is not actually biased,” he added.

The study, published in the journal Nature, discusses what happens when models are trained on data generated by AI over multiple cycles.


The research found that after a few loops of AI models generating and then being trained on AI-generated content, the systems start making significant errors and fall into nonsense.

A separate paper by Duke University researcher Emily Wenger demonstrates this through an experiment where an AI model is continuously trained on AI-generated content.

In the experiment, an AI model was given a set of data containing pictures of different dog breeds, with an overrepresentation of golden retrievers.

The study found that the model's output was more likely to generate images of golden retrievers than other less-represented dog breeds. As the cycle continued, it gradually started leaving out other dog breeds entirely until it eventually started generating nonsense.

Stages of ‘model collapse’
""Model collapse is basically defined by two stages. The first stage is what we call the early-stage model collapse, and what happens here is when a model learns from another model, you first observe a reduction in variance,"" Shumailov said.

In this stage, aspects not initially fully understood by the original model will also be poorly understood by the subsequent model trained on the previous one's outputs.

This results in oversampling the well-understood aspects while neglecting other important ones simply because they were not fully clear to the initial model.

Then comes the late-stage model collapse.


ADVERTISEMENT
This is when AI models are no longer useful due to earlier models introducing their own errors into the data.

The errors present in the initial data are passed onto the next model, which adds its own set of errors and passes it on as well.

As the data is continuously produced and recycled, the models start misinterpreting reality and making more errors.

“If there are some errors inside of the data that were generated by model one, they basically propagate into the next model. And ultimately this results in the model basically misperceiving the reality,” Shumailov explained.


ADVERTISEMENT
Types of AI model errors
According to Shumailov, there are three types of errors that models could make: architecture errors, learning process errors, and statistical errors.

Architecture errors occur when the structure of the AI model is not fit to capture all the complexities in the data it is provided with, leading to inaccuracies as some parts are misunderstood or oversimplified by the model.

Learning process errors happen when the methods used to train the models have inherent biases, which pushes the model to make certain types of mistakes.

Finally, statistical errors emerge when there isn't enough data to accurately represent what the model is trying to learn. This could drive the model to generate predictions based on incomplete information, resulting in error.

Implications of ‘model collapse’
When models collapse, the main concern is that the rate of improvements in their performance may slow down.

AI models rely heavily on the quality of the data they’re trained on.

However, when they’re trained on AI-generated content, this data continuously introduces errors into the system.

""It's likely that we'll have to spend additional effort in basically filtering out the data. And this probably will mean that there may be a slowdown in improvement,” Shumailov said.


ADVERTISEMENT
Moreover, as variance decreases and the data becomes less diverse, underrepresented data are expected to be disproportionately affected, which raises concerns over the inclusivity of the AI models.

""We need to be extremely careful in making sure that our models are fair and that they don't lose track of the minority data inside of them,” Shumailov said.";Model collapse?;"- **Model Collapse:** ⚠️ A new study warns that AI models may fail as they rely on AI-generated content for training.

You’ve read the think pieces. AI—in particular, the generative AI (gen AI) breakthroughs achieved in the past year or so—is poised to revolutionize not just the way we create content but the very makeup of our economies and societies as a whole. But although gen AI tools such as ChatGPT may seem like a great leap forward, in reality they are just a step in the direction of an even greater breakthrough: artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

AGI is AI with capabilities that rival those of a human. While purely theoretical at this stage, someday AGI may replicate human-like cognitive abilities including reasoning, problem solving, perception, learning, and language comprehension. When AI’s abilities are indistinguishable from those of a human, it will have passed what is known as the Turing test, first proposed by 20th-century computer scientist Alan Turing.

But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. AI has made significant strides in recent years, but no AI tool to date has passed the Turing test. We’re still far from reaching a point where AI tools can understand, communicate, and act with the same nuance and sensitivity of a human—and, critically, understand the meaning behind it. Most researchers and academics believe we are decades away from realizing AGI; a few even predict we won’t see AGI this century (or ever). Rodney Brooks, a roboticist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and cofounder of iRobot, believes AGI won’t arrive until the year 2300.

If you’re thinking that AI already seems pretty smart, that’s understandable. We’ve seen gen AI do remarkable things in recent years, from writing code to composing sonnets in seconds. But there’s a critical difference between AI and AGI. Although the latest gen AI technologies, including ChatGPT, DALL-E, and others, have been hogging headlines, they are essentially prediction machines—albeit very good ones. In other words, they can predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the answer to a specific prompt because they’ve been trained on huge amounts of data. This is impressive, but it’s not at a human level of performance in terms of creativity, logical reasoning, sensory perception, and other capabilities. By contrast, AGI tools could feature cognitive and emotional abilities (like empathy) indistinguishable from those of a human. Depending on your definition of AGI, they might even be capable of consciously grasping the meaning behind what they’re doing.

The timing of AGI’s emergence is uncertain. But when it does arrive—and it likely will at some point—it’s going to be a very big deal for every aspect of our lives, businesses, and societies. Executives can begin working now to better understand the path to machines achieving human-level intelligence and making the transition to a more automated world.

What is needed for AI to become AGI?
Here are eight capabilities AI needs to master before achieving AGI. Click each card to learn more.

“An eye shape with a blue iris and pupil that together resemble a camera lens. Above and below the main eye are two smaller eyes, and a viewfinder surrounds the stack of three eyes.”
Visual perception
“An ear is pictured with three wavy lines connecting it to the larger world. Along the lines are blue and purple dots indicating sound flowing into the ear.”
Audio perception
“A hand delicately grips a blue pencil between an index finger and thumb. At the tip of the pencil is an arrow in a circle shape, indicating careful and precise movement.”
Fine motor skills
“Three chat bubbles overlap one another. One of the overlapping segments is blue, and one is pink; the center overlapping segment where all chat bubbles intersect is black, with three white dots indicating that someone is typing.”
Natural language processing
“Two hands with thumbs and index fingers extended form a rectangle around four puzzle pieces that have been fit together. Lines emanating from the puzzle indicate that it has just been completed in a satisfying way.”
Problem-solving
“A globe icon is surrounded by pin-drop symbols in the four cardinal locations. North and south are blue; east and west are pink.”
Navigation
“A cartoon character’s head and shoulders are depicted. The cartoon character’s eyes are closed in satisfaction, and it’s wearing a big smile. Out of its head sprouts a network of connected pink and purple dots.”
Creativity
“Two white cartoon heads sit back to back. Their heads overlap; on one overlapping side, the color is pink; on the other, it’s blue. One of the faces is smiling slightly, and the other is frowning slightly.”
Social and emotional engagement
How will people access AGI tools?
Today, most people engage with AI in the same ways they’ve accessed digital power for years: via 2D screens such as laptops, smartphones, and TVs. The future will probably look a lot different. Some of the brightest minds (and biggest budgets) in tech are devoting themselves to figuring out how we’ll access AI (and possibly AGI) in the future. One example you’re likely familiar with is augmented reality and virtual reality headsets, through which users experience an immersive virtual world. Another example would be humans accessing the AI world through implanted neurons in the brain. This might sound like something out of a sci-fi novel, but it’s not. In January 2024, Neuralink implanted a chip in a human brain, with the goal of allowing the human to control a phone or computer purely by thought.

A final mode of interaction with AI seems ripped from sci-fi as well: robots. These can take the form of mechanized limbs connected to humans or machine bases or even programmed humanoid robots.";What is artificial general intelligence;"- **Definition of AGI:**  **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** is a theoretical form of AI that can perform tasks at a human level.

dee6a299;da99ba64;;a6a826ea;ba41e0ee;Science and Technology;;34324;"What is a robot and what types of robots are there?
The simplest definition of a robot is a machine that can perform tasks on its own or with minimal assistance from humans. The most sophisticated robots can also interact with their surroundings.

Programmable robots have been operational since the 1950s. McKinsey estimates that 3.5 million robots are currently in use, with 550,000 more deployed every year. But while programmable robots are more commonplace than ever in the workforce, they have a long way to go before they outnumber their human counterparts. The Republic of Korea, home to the world’s highest density of robots, still employs 100 times as many humans as robots.

But as hardware and software limitations become increasingly surmountable, companies that manufacture robots are beginning to program units with new AI tools and techniques. These dramatically improve robots’ ability to perform tasks typically handled by humans, including walking, sensing, communicating, and manipulating objects. In May 2023, Sanctuary AI, for example, launched Phoenix, a bipedal humanoid robot that stands 5’ 7” tall, lifts objects weighing as much as 55 pounds, and travels three miles per hour—not to mention it also folds clothes, stocks shelves, and works a register.

As we edge closer to AGI, we can expect increasingly sophisticated AI tools and techniques to be programmed into robots of all kinds. Here are a few categories of robots that are currently operational:

Stand-alone autonomous industrial robots: Equipped with sensors and computer systems to navigate their surroundings and interact with other machines, these robots are critical components of the modern automated manufacturing industry.
Collaborative robots: Also known as cobots, these robots are specifically engineered to operate in collaboration with humans in a shared environment. Their primary purpose is to alleviate repetitive or hazardous tasks. These types of robots are already being used in environments such as restaurant kitchens and more.
Mobile robots: Utilizing wheels as their primary means of movement, mobile robots are commonly used for materials handling in warehouses and factories. The military also uses these machines for various purposes, such as reconnaissance and bomb disposal.
Human–hybrid robots: These robots have both human and robotic features. This could include a robot with an appearance, movement capabilities, or cognition that resemble those of a human, or a human with a robotic limb or even a brain implant.
Humanoids or androids: These robots are designed to emulate the appearance, movement, communicative abilities, and emotions of humans while continuously enhancing their cognitive capabilities via deep learning models. In other words, humanoid robots will think like a human, move like a human, and look like a human.

What advances could speed up the development of AGI?
Advances in algorithms, computing, and data have brought about the recent acceleration of AI. We can get a sense of what the future may hold by looking at these three capabilities:

Algorithmic advances and new robotics approaches. We may need entirely new approaches to algorithms and robots to achieve AGI. One way researchers are thinking about this is by exploring the concept of embodied cognition. The idea is that robots will need to learn very quickly from their environments through a multitude of senses, just like humans do when they’re very young. Similarly, to develop cognition in the same way humans do, robots will need to experience the physical world like we do (because we’ve designed our spaces based on how our bodies and minds work).

The latest AI-based robot systems are using gen AI technologies including large language models (LLMs) and large behavior models (LBMs). LLMs give robots advanced natural-language-processing capabilities like what we’ve seen with generative AI models and other LLM-enabled tools. LBMs allow robots to emulate human actions and movements. These models are created by training AI on large data sets of observed human actions and movements. Ultimately, these models could allow robots to perform a wide range of activities with limited task-specific training.

A real advance would be to develop new AI systems that start out with a certain level of built-in knowledge, just like a baby fawn knows how to stand and feed without being taught. It’s possible that the recent success of deep-learning-based AI systems may have drawn research attention away from the more fundamental cognitive work required to make progress toward AGI.

Computing advancements. Graphics processing units (GPUs) have made the major AI advances of the past few years possible. Here’s why. For one, GPUs are designed to handle multiple tasks related to visual data simultaneously, including rendering images, videos, and graphics-related computations. Their efficiency at handling massive amounts of visual data makes them useful in training complex neural networks. They also have a high memory bandwidth, meaning faster data transfer. Before AGI can be achieved, similar significant advancements will need to be made in computing infrastructure. Quantum computing is touted as one way of achieving this. However, today’s quantum computers, while powerful, aren’t yet ready for everyday applications. But once they are, they could play a role in the achievement of AGI.
Growth in data volume and new sources of data. Some experts believe 5G mobile infrastructure could bring about a significant increase in data. That’s because the technology could power a surge in connected devices, or the Internet of Things. But, for a variety of reasons, we think most of the benefits of 5G have already appeared. For AGI to be achieved, there will need to be another catalyst for a huge increase in data volume.

New robotics approaches could yield new sources of training data. Placing human-like robots among us could allow companies to mine large sets of data that mimic our own senses to help the robots train themselves. Advanced self-driving cars are one example: data is being collected from cars that are already on the roads, so these vehicles are acting as a training set for future self-driving cars.

What can executives do about AGI?
AGI is still decades away, at the very least. But AI is here to stay—and it is advancing extremely quickly. Smart leaders can think about how to respond to the real progress that’s happening, as well as how to prepare for the automated future. Here are a few things to consider:

Stay informed about developments in AI and AGI. Connect with start-ups and develop a framework for tracking progress in AGI that is relevant to your business. Also, start to think about the right governance, conditions, and boundaries for success within your business and communities.
Invest in AI now. “The cost of doing nothing,” says McKinsey senior partner Nicolai Müller, “is just too high because everybody has this at the top of their agenda. I think it’s the one topic that every management board has looked into, that every CEO has explored across all regions and industries.” The organizations that get it right now will be poised to win in the coming era.
Continue to place humans at the center. Invest in human–machine interfaces, or “human in the loop” technologies that augment human intelligence. People at all levels of an organization need training and support to thrive in an increasingly automated world. AI is just the latest tool to help individuals and companies alike boost their efficiency.
Consider the ethical and security implications. This should include addressing cybersecurity, data privacy, and algorithm bias.
Build a strong foundation of data, talent, and capabilities. AI runs on data; having a strong foundation of high-quality data is critical to its success.
Organize your workers for new economies of scale and skill. Yesterday’s rigid organizational structures and operating models aren’t suited to the reality of rapidly advancing AI. One way to address this is by instituting flow-to-the-work models, where people can move seamlessly between initiatives and groups.
Place small bets to preserve strategic options in areas of your business that are exposed to AI developments. For example, consider investing in technology firms that are pursuing ambitious AI research and development projects in your industry. Not all these bets will necessarily pay off, but they could help hedge some of the existential risk your business may face in the future.

Ragtime

Ragtime
Credit: Joan Marcus
Anyone lucky enough to experience the dazzling Broadway revival of Ragtime will be hard-pressed to believe that in 1998, the musical was a $10 million financial flop, a critical miss, and an awards-season also-ran — it had the misfortune to open a few months after The Lion King. (And as if losing the Best Musical Tony Award to a super-pricey puppet show weren’t enough, Ragtime‘s producers flamed out in a very public accounting scandal. Just months ago, impresario Garth Drabinsky received seven years in prison for his part in a half-billion-dollar fraud scheme.)

More than a decade later, a leaner, less lavish, yet somehow even richer incarnation of the turn-of-the-20th-century-era musical has been neatly fitted into Broadway’s Neil Simon Theatre. But this is no penny-pinching, recession-era Ragtime. Stephen Flaherty’s music — appropriately entrenched in the titular jagged, syncopated rhythms made so famous by the likes of Scott Joplin — gets the full 28-piece orchestra treatment. A cast of 40 — huge by today’s Broadway standards — portrays the colorful panoply of characters created by E.L. Doctorow in his 1975 historical novel, which Terrence McNally’s libretto has deftly distilled into three main story lines: the white New Rochelle, N.Y., elite, led by burgeoning liberal Mother (Christiane Noll), blatantly bigoted Father (Ron Bohmer), and Mother’s recalcitrant Younger Brother (Bobby Steggert); the just-off-the-”rag ship” immigrants like Latvian Jewish silhouette maker Tateh (Robert Petkoff) and his Little Girl (Sarah Rosenthal); and the men and women of Harlem, represented by ragtime musician-turned-militant rebel Coalhouse Walker Jr. (Quentin Earl Darrington), whose efforts to retrieve his love, Sarah (Stephanie Umoh), from Mother and Father’s home escalate into a shooting spree.

Various headline-making historical figures pop in and out along the way: revolutionary Emma Goldman (Donna Migliaccio), ”vaudeville tart” Evelyn Nesbit (Savannah Wise), educator Booker T. Washington (Eric Jordan Young), banker J.P. Morgan (Michael X. Martin), industrialist Henry Ford (Aaron Galligan-Stierle), escape artist Harry Houdini (Jonathan Hammond). It’s here that McNally’s skill as a playwright — and as an editor — truly shows: He cut down Doctorow’s crazy quilt of intersecting plotlines, smartly placing the real-life characters mostly on the musical’s outskirts.

Even Santo Loquasto’s stunningly detailed period costumes and accessories have been reinvented, with intricate layers of lace and pearlescent parasols for Mother, sequined come-and-get-it corsets and shimmery stockings for showgirl Nesbit. Apart from some small nips and tucks in the score, the only economizing is in the sets — or, rather, the set, singular. Derek McLane (33 Variations) has framed the entire stage in a series of exposed beams, tiers, and steps. Everything about this production is open (Coalhouse’s piano is a mere shell, as is his prized Model T) so that all it takes is a chord progression and a lighting cue to shift from a nightclub to a factory. The set’s tiers also signify class, dividing the immigrants from the African-Americans from the whites. (In the second act, note how Tateh and his daughter, he with a better-trimmed beard and she in a new dress, have risen to a higher level).

Dodge’s greatest strength as a director is keeping the actors moving, particularly in the glorious opening number, which hauls out practically every character in the proverbial melting pot: ”beggar and millionaire/everyone, everywhere/moving to the ragtime!” (In fact, her staging is so superior that one is inclined to forgive her insipid assembly-line choreography.) And she has corralled an almost uniformly first-rate ensemble: The barrel-chested Darrington is a booming, powerful Coalhouse who is physically and vocally different from his predecessor in the role, Brian Stokes Mitchell, but no less effective; Umoh, however, is simply not up to his level (at the performance I saw, she missed one too many notes in her wrenching aria ”Your Daddy’s Son”). And after years of playing the bland-and-blond ingénue in shows like Miss Saigon and Jekyll & Hyde, Noll has been rewarded with a career-making role and the show-stopping, 11 o’clock number ”Back to Before.” She’s brilliant, uncovering in Mother an unexpected (and alluring) edge: ”If I had dreams, then I let you dream them for me,” she sings almost resentfully.

And therein lies the biggest difference between the old and new Ragtime: edge. The opulent original production radiated an almost blinding streak of sun-soaked late-’90s optimism. This darker revival is by no means a bummer; it’s simply more grounded in reality. With its wonderful blend of nostalgia, anger, patriotism, and hard-won idealism, perhaps Ragtime is simply a better suited to 2009.

How to Compose Science Fiction Music: My Personal Recipe
If you been reading my posts for the last week or so, then you’ll have noticed that I’ve recently been spending my days writing science fiction-related music.

Also, a lot of the search engine terms used that send traffic here to my blog are along the lines of ‘how to write film music’, so here’s one for you guys and gals.

My own personal shortcut recipe for writing sci-fi tunes:
Liberally mix major and minor scales and lydian mode up in your sequencer, using strings and/or pads for your harmonies.
Sprinkle in relationships of the tritone – use them in your suspensions instead of whatever otherwise fits with the key.
Build major chords on every note of your melody and use that for your harmony, a la Williams.
Go to new, unrelated keys regularly – flat or minor 6th relationships especially. Don’t bother modulating.
Bring out the trumpets! All the brass deserve massive fanfares suggestive of ‘coming to the rescue’. 
Soaring french horns.
Extreme contrasts of dynamics – subito fff and ppp are de rigeur for adjacent passages.
Use ‘acousmetre’ for anything vaguely alien or otherworldly. Originally describing the voice, this term describes any sound that the audience has no idea of how it was created, and so will get uncomfortable, uncertain, apprehensive, a little bit scared. Think: weird sounds. Electroacoustic stuff. Spooky sound design.
Get mechanical and repetitive in your counterpoint, especially when describing futuristic or alien technologies.
These are definitely my personal top tips for composing music with a science fiction ‘flavour’, but it would be great to know if you’ve any more to add!";Write sci-fi music creatively;"- **Mixing Scales:**  Use a blend of **major** and **minor scales** along with **Lydian mode** to create a unique sound.  
- **Harmonies:**  Utilize **strings** and **pads** for rich harmonies.  
- **Tritone Relationships:** ⚖️ Incorporate **tritone** intervals for suspenseful moments instead of standard fits.  
- **Chords on Melody:**  Build **major chords** on each note of your melody for harmony, inspired by composers like **John Williams**.  
- **Key Changes:**  Explore new, unrelated keys, especially **flat** or **minor 6th** relationships without modulating.  
- **Brass Fanfare:**  Use **trumpets** for heroic fanfares, suggestive of rescue scenarios.  
- **Dynamic Contrasts:**  Implement extreme dynamics, alternating between **fortissimo (fff)** and **pianissimo (ppp)**.  
- **Acousmetre Sounds:**  Incorporate sounds that are mysterious or alien, causing unease in the audience.  
- **Mechanical Counterpoint:**  Use repetitive patterns to represent futuristic or alien technology.

Written By Dan Schwebel

Chiptune us a genre that holds a unique place in the musical spectrum. Also often referred to as 8-bit music or chip music, takes us back to the days when video game soundtracks were crafted with simplistic, yet deeply evocative melodies that hold the distinct charm of early computing technology. This music, created on or emulating the sound of vintage computers and gaming consoles, has managed to capture the imagination of composers and listeners alike, turning what was once a technological limitation into an art form in its own right.

But chiptune is more than a nostalgic tribute to the video game soundtracks of the past. It's a vibrant, innovative genre that continues to evolve and inspire, providing a canvas for musical creativity that extends well beyond the realm of gaming. From its humble beginnings in the demoscene of the 1980s, chiptune has infiltrated various forms of media and culture, while nurturing a passionate community of artists and enthusiasts who push its boundaries.

I want to delve into the origins, culture, and characteristics of chiptune, and explore its many sub-genres, key artists, and examine the tools used to make this music – particularly the Little Sound DJ (LSDJ), a Game Boy sequencer that has become synonymous with chiptune creation.

The Origins of Chiptune
To fully appreciate chiptune music, it's essential to take a step back in time and understand its roots. The genre’s origins are firmly planted in the technological limitations of the early computing and gaming industry, where small storage space and rudimentary sound chips led to the creation of uniquely simple, yet expressive music.

Chiptune, or chip music, as it was initially known, first made its mark in the 1980s. During this period, home computers like the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and the Amiga, as well as gaming consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the Game Boy, were growing in popularity. These machines had basic sound chips that could only produce a limited range of sounds. However, this didn't stop composers from creating memorable and emotionally engaging music that added depth to the gaming experience.

One of the earliest and most influential platforms for chiptune music was the demoscene. This was a subculture where programmers, artists, and musicians collaborated to create complex audio-visual presentations that demonstrated their coding prowess and creativity, despite the constrained capabilities of the hardware.

While initially tied to these computing platforms, chiptune began to evolve as musicians recognized the distinctive, nostalgic charm of the 8-bit sound, and started to incorporate it into broader music production. The advent of music software like trackers, and later, digital audio workstations (DAWs) and software synthesizers, opened up even more possibilities.

The accessibility of tools like LSDJ (Little Sound DJ), a sequencer software created for the Game Boy, played a pivotal role in the democratization of chiptune music. It enabled artists with a Game Boy and a creative spark to produce complex musical pieces, further pushing the boundaries of what chiptune could be.

Today, chiptune is recognized as a genre in its own right, boasting a vibrant scene that has spread across the globe, while still maintaining its nostalgic ties to the gaming and computing history that birthed it.

Defining Chiptune
Chiptune, also referred to as chip music or 8-bit music, is a genre characterized by the use of vintage computer or video game console sound chips to produce music. It captures the aesthetic of the sound of early video games and home computers.

However, understanding chiptune involves distinguishing between chiptune and 8-bit music, as these terms, while often used interchangeably, do have subtle differences.

Chiptune Music:
Chiptune refers to music made by the sound chips of old computers, consoles, or arcade machines. It does not necessarily have to be 8-bit; it could also be 16-bit or 32-bit, depending on the hardware used. The term ""chiptune"" comes from ""chip"" (referring to the sound chip) and ""tune"". 

The key characteristics of chiptune music include:

Limited Polyphony: Due to the limitations of early sound chips, chiptune music often features a limited number of simultaneous notes, typically ranging from 3 to 5. This resulted in music with a thin, distinctive texture.

Simplistic Waveforms: The sound chips were only capable of producing simple waveforms like square, triangle, and noise waves, which gives chiptune its distinctively raw and lo-fi tone.

Techniques: Techniques unique to the genre, like arpeggiation (playing rapid sequences of notes to simulate chords that couldn't be played simultaneously), add to the signature chiptune sound.

As a non-purist, I do believe that emulation and synthesis can replicate this accurately, thus broadening and democratising the genre.

8-bit Music:
8-bit music specifically refers to music made using 8-bit sound chips, most commonly found in vintage consoles like the NES or Game Boy. It's a subset of chiptune, with the term ""8-bit"" reflecting the 8-bit architecture of these consoles.

In a broader sense, ""8-bit music"" is sometimes used to describe music that emulates the style of chiptune, even if it wasn't made with actual vintage hardware or software designed to mimic these sound chips. However, purists might argue that true 8-bit music can only be made with actual 8-bit hardware or accurate emulations thereof.

In conclusion, while all 8-bit music can be considered chiptune, not all chiptune music is 8-bit. The genre continues to inspire artists and musicians worldwide, as they explore its unique aesthetic and innovate within its constraints. Despite its retro origins, chiptune remains a forward-thinking genre, a testament to the creativity that can thrive amidst limitations";Define chiptune music;"- **Definition of Chiptune:**  Chiptune, or **8-bit music**, is a genre created using vintage computer and video game console sound chips.

Chiptune Creation with LSDJ
Creating chiptune music with Little Sound DJ (LSDJ) turns your Game Boy into a powerful music workstation. The software allows for intricate sequencing, sample manipulation, and real-time control during live performances. This guide will provide an in-depth walkthrough of the process, from setting up LSDJ to creating your first sequence.

n.b. I am merely writing this as a placeholder. With an aim of end of 2023-to-early-2024 I plan on creating a video tutorial.

1. Getting Started with LSDJ:

LSDJ can be purchased as a ROM file from the official website, which you can then load onto a flash cartridge, such as the EverDrive GB or the ElCheapoSD. The cartridge can be inserted into a Game Boy like any game cartridge. When you boot up the Game Boy, you will be greeted with the LSDJ interface.

2. Understanding the LSDJ Interface:

LSDJ has four main screens that you can toggle through by pressing the select button. These are:

The Song Screen, where you can arrange different sections of your song.

The Chain Screen, where you can build sequences of phrases.

The Phrase Screen, where you can compose short sequences of notes or beats.

The Instrument Screen, where you can customize the sound of your instruments.

Each screen has different functions, and mastering how to navigate between them is crucial to mastering LSDJ.

3. Building Your First Chain and Phrase:

To start, navigate to the Chain Screen and input a hexadecimal number (00 to FF) to create a new chain. This number represents a unique identifier for the chain, allowing you to use it multiple times throughout your song.

Next, navigate to the Phrase Screen and input different hexadecimal numbers to create new phrases. In chiptune, a phrase is typically a short sequence of notes or beats. The notes are input using a combination of buttons on the Game Boy (for example, A+Up inputs a note, while A+Left/Right changes the pitch).

4. Creating Instruments:

Navigate to the Instrument Screen to create and customize your own instruments. Here you can adjust parameters like envelope, wave, and sweep to change how your instrument sounds.

The envelope controls the volume and decay of a note, wave alters the waveform of the note, and sweep can modify the pitch of the note over time. By manipulating these parameters, you can create a wide range of sounds.

5. Sequencing and Song Construction:

Once you've created chains, phrases, and instruments, you can start building your song in the Song Screen. This involves organizing your chains in the desired order to create the structure of your song.

During sequencing, you can make changes to your chains and phrases in real-time, allowing for a great deal of flexibility in composition.

Creating music with LSDJ is a deep and complex process, but it's also incredibly rewarding. This software turns the humble Game Boy into a powerful tool for chiptune composition, allowing you to explore the unique sonic palette of 8-bit music. With practice and patience, you'll soon be creating your own chiptune masterpieces.

6. Advanced Techniques:

After mastering the basics, you can start exploring some of LSDJ's advanced features. For instance, tables allow you to apply complex modulation to your instruments, enabling effects such as vibrato, slides, or arpeggios. Tables are sequences of commands that are applied to notes and can be triggered in the Instrument Screen.

Command automation is another advanced technique that can add depth and complexity to your music. By inputting commands into the Phrase Screen, you can automate changes in volume, pitch, or instrument parameters. This allows for dynamic changes within a phrase.

7. Live Performance:

LSDJ also features several tools that can enhance live performances. The groove feature lets you create custom swing patterns that can be applied to your chains, adding a more human feel to your sequences. The mute function allows you to mute and unmute channels on the fly, providing a simple way to create breakdowns or transitions.

Furthermore, LSDJ supports MIDI sync, so you can connect your Game Boy to other devices, like drum machines or synthesizers, to integrate it into a larger setup.

Mastering LSDJ takes time and patience, but the payoff is the ability to compose complex and expressive music using just a Game Boy. The software's depth and flexibility make it a powerful tool for any chiptune artist, whether you're a beginner just starting out or a seasoned composer looking for new sonic possibilities.

This additional information brings the word count close to the 500-word mark, providing a more comprehensive guide to creating chiptune music with LSDJ.

Moreover, developers could focus primarily on games, and music composers were finally able to write multidimensional music. However, console companies utilized the technology differently.

Nintendo stopped using the Ricoh sound chips with the Super Nintendo in favor of the new S-SMP (Sony Sound and Music Processor), which consisted of the SPC-700 audio chip and 64KB of SRAM (static RAM). While the sound and music process was still very technical, programmers had more freedom. Composers and developers could write programs to have the S-SMP tell the SPC-700 what sounds to make. Unlike the 2A03, which had five channels that could only produce specific waveforms, the S-SMP combo had eight channels and was sample based. However, music programmers were limited to 64KB of audio RAM, including sound effects — for an entire game!


The Sound Capabilities of the SNES
Fitting Entire Soundtracks in Less Than 64KB of RAM
Creating music with such a small file-size limit was a painstakingly long process because composers often had to cut down samples to a single-cycle waveform to fit the 64KB size limit. To make things easy, video game composer David Wise took inspiration from the technology of the Korg Wavestation, which used wave sequencing (this feature is also found in the Korg Wavestate).

After recording one waveform at many different frequencies, he input each into a program individually by using HEX code. The most-recognized example is his composition “Aquatic Ambiance” from the original Donkey Kong Country soundtrack.

The Rise of the Synth
In the ’80s, FM synths took the world by storm with Yamaha leading the charge. As they became more available commercially, large sound chips meant for full-size synth keyboards could be miniaturized to fit onto a console’s circuit board. Video game composers took advantage of this because the instruments and sound effects sounded more pleasing, but they also relied less on the system’s memory.

While Nintendo was still using a Sony-based sound chip in the mid-’80s, Yamaha produced sound chips that manufacturers like Sega would use for gaming machines. The first was the YM2151 (their first single-chip FM synth), used in games such as Marble Madness and various arcade games from companies like Konami. It would become the predecessor of the 2164, which was used in synths like the DX100.

Sega Genesis
Sega released the Genesis console a year before the SNES was released (you may also hear it called Sega Mega Drive). Unlike the SNES, which used the 8-channelS-SMP sound system, Sega had used the 4-channel TI SN76486 and the 6-channel Yamaha 2612 sound chip. The chip was a stripped-down version of the YM21280, which was used on one of the most recognized synths ever known: the Yamaha DX7.

Before you hear the differences between the SNES and the Genesis, it’s important to note that, while they may have sounded different, ultimately, the final product was a sum of not only all its technical parts but also the composers behind it.

Sample Away
Not all consoles back in the ’90s used FM synthesis. In the mid-’90s, disc-based consoles became more popular, particularly the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation. While systems like the Genesis and SNES could use sampled sounds, consoles like the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation (PS1) were able to perfect it, thanks to advancements in technology.

Since they used CDs, composers didn’t have to worry about writing within the constraint of 64KB of RAM. They could now use 16-bit, 44.1kHz uncompressed CD-quality samples on 512KB of RAM stored on the game’s 600MB disc. The one big difference between the Saturn and PlayStation is that the PlayStation could play 24 continuous samples, whereas the Saturn could play 32.

The Odd One Out
While the disc-based PlayStation and Saturn were popular, the second highest-selling console at the time was the Nintendo 64. Like their oddly shaped game controllers, the approach to sound was entirely different not only from the disc-based PS1 and Saturn but also its predecessor, the SNES. Unlike the other consoles (even the SNES), the N64 had no sound chip, so all audio was played by the console’s 64-bit processor.

Just like the SNES, the other big issue was a limited amount of space. An N64 cartridge could only hold 64MB of data, and, since the games were graphics-heavy, only a sliver was dedicated to audio. Yet again, composers needed to get creative. They would have to compress MIDI files and use sound fonts for everything to fit. Let’s listen to how different the Sega and Sony disc-based consoles sounded compared to the cartridge-based N64.


A DAW — As a Video Game?
If you didn’t have a computer or audio-recording gear or you were just a gamer who wanted to create some music, then Sony released a DAW video game that anyone could use to create their music! Like Fruity Loops (now called FL Studio), Music 2000 was a step-sequenced-based DAW with plenty of sounds and instruments to choose from. Interestingly, there’s still a community that writes music with Music 2000 to this day!

What About Computers?
We’ve talked a lot about consoles, but what about home computers? The evolution of PC video game sound is less confusing. While they were based on a similar architecture, the PCs were ahead of the curve. It essentially went from a built-in computer speaker to a sound card you had to install then to USB external audio interfaces.

For the longest time, PCs used a small beeper speaker controlled by the computer’s CPU to produce sound. And, while the mid-’80s had the PCJr and Tandy 1000, they only made three-voice sounds. In 1987, a PC sound card would be released that changed the future of video game audio: the AdLib music synthesizer.

The AdLib used a Yamaha YM3812, an 11-channel FM-based sound chip that could play 11 continuous sounds or six channels of sound with five percussive instruments, which meant video game composers and programmers could get creative. While it sounds elementary compared to today’s standards, it was groundbreaking technology.


Original Ad Lib Sound Card Promotion 
Roland MT-32
The Roland MT-32 was also an extremely popular choice, but it was a relatively bulky external MIDI module and was a little expensive. At the time, it cost $695 ($1,600 today), which was three times more costly than the original Sound Blaster, which was $240 ($605 in today’s money)! That said, the Roland MT-32 had a smoother, higher-quality sound. Here’s an example of the sound of each different sound card.

Blast Off!
For a short while, the AdLib was the popular choice in PC gaming. However, Creative Labs would build the game-changing audio card that would become the industry standard. That audio card was called the Sound Blaster. It utilized DSP, or what Creative Labs called Digital Sound Processor (NOT to be confused with digital signal processor). While external audio interfaces are very popular among gamers, Sound Blaster remains the de facto standard for gaming audio.

Though technology was the driving force behind video gaming and music, composers and music programmers were the unsung heroes. Some programmed music in HEX code, and some used recording software, like world-renowned composer Inon Zur, who used Steinberg’s Pro 24 (which later evolved into Cubase) and Emagic (later called Logic). While primitive by today’s standards, software like Pro 24 was groundbreaking. You could sit down with a keyboard, press the record button, and start recording music. However, the additional hardware required to achieve professional results was a bit much.


1986: Steinberg Pro 24 and Atari ST
As time passed, music (and game) technology changed faster than Sonic the Hedgehog could run. Computers became faster and more powerful, DAWs added new features (and, more importantly, higher channel counts, which we’ll talk about in a little bit), and gear became more readily available. Video game composers no longer needed to rely so much on programming MIDI, and they could now write, perform, and record in real time anywhere.

Current State of Affairs
Phew! In just over 40 years, we’ve come from beeps and boops to crystal-clear digitally recorded audio. From multigenre to orchestral and heavy metal, there’s no denying how far we have come. Each composer has different methods, but all of them share one thing in common: creating memorable music for generations to enjoy.

For example, Inon Zur worked with live symphony orchestras for games like Syberia and the highly anticipated release of Starfield. Meanwhile, indie video game composers like Darren Korb and Jacob Foxe connect gear to a four-channel audio interface and press the record button in a DAW.

Thanks to advancements in music technology, video game composers who need dramatic orchestral music and don’t have symphony orchestras at their disposal can now use virtual instruments. VIs (virtual instruments) like EastWest Hollywood Orchestra Opus sound so much like the real thing, they can get similar results right in their studio!

What About Other Genres?
Orchestras and choirs are prevalent in video game soundtracks nowadays, and rightfully so! There’s nothing like a dynamic orchestral piece, particularly for main themes and boss battles, but not every game requires an orchestral soundtrack. However, it doesn’t always have to be the case. For example, if you listen to the soundtrack from the video game Rocket League, it’s all EDM. Why? Because it fits the style of the game. If you had a 100-piece orchestra, then it would have a completely different vibe and may not make the game as enjoyable as it is. Even heavy metal has become commonplace!

In the words of iconic vocalist David Coverdale, “I don’t know where I’m going, but I sure know where I’ve been.” To answer that question, I went straight to the source and asked some of the most recognized video game composers two questions:

“Video game and music technology have evolved quite a bit, even in the past decade. Do you think technology will evolve even further? If so, where do you think it will go?”

Inon Zur (Dragon Age, Syberia, Fallout)
“There are two branches of evolvement and humankind. One of them is purely technical. We know that the technical aspect will always evolve. Computers are going way faster, and it will be easier to enhance AI. You know artificial intelligence will start becoming more and more a part of our lives, and it will also take a stand when it comes to scoring games.”

“The more modern thinking is that the game company will create the soundtrack for the game, and the game will pick up its music queue and put it inside the game based on the gamer’s preferences, so, basically, it’s personalizing your own soundtrack. We’re a little far from this, but this is where it will gravitate from a technical point of view, and it will really influence your artistic choices and how it will work.”


Starfield Suite – Inon Zur

Darren Korb (Hades, Bastion, Pyre)

“It certainly has! I can only assume it will become even more powerful and cheaper to access if this same trend continues. I know for a fact that if I had started working on Bastion even two years earlier, I wouldn’t have been able to approach the music the same way. Just the change from Logic 7 to Logic 8 really shaped my workflow and allowed me to iterate on ideas quickly and access tons of sounds easily.”

“I think the improvements to ease of use, lower prices, and increasingly powerful tools will continue to be helpful to me and others looking to make the most of a minimal home-studio setup. On the game side, the middleware used to integrate music into games is advancing, as well! The ease of doing really interesting stuff with dynamic music and multi-stem playback of pieces with lots of interactivity has drastically improved over the last 12 years or so, and that’s something I’m excited about for the future of game music.”

Chase Bethea (Aground, Aztec Ride)
“Yes, I do. People are always pushing forward in efficient workflows, and they use technology to achieve that. From EQs like FabFilter, SplitEQ, and Soothe2 to speaker monitors such as Kii and Fluid Audio. Even in game audio, middleware like ELIAS and Wwise are evolving in ways that give people another way to experience audio in other mediums of entertainment. MIDI 2.0 offers a plethora of new audio and video techniques to enhance workflow efficiency. Tool sets and guidelines will be more defined as more people use headphones for immersion. [HRTF — Head Related Transfer Functions] locality practices are to be considered in relation to references on VR/MR/AR/XR peripherals. Waves Nx and Sound Particles are making incredible technological advances such as creating virtual mix rooms that emulate world-class acoustically treated studios and buildings.”


“Tale of Time” composed by Chase Bethea

Jacob Foxe (Verdancy Vale)
“This question is very interesting to me since my degree is in computer hardware engineering. Video game technology is evolving quickly because there’s a lot of money in the field, and I think that will only continue down the road. Many people herald VR and AR (virtual reality and augmented reality) as the future of gaming. While I’d love for that to be the case, I think we have a couple of decades left before those media are perfected to the point where AAA companies will develop games for them.”

“As we’ve seen in recent years with the Nintendo Switch and the newer Steam Deck, many companies have turned their gazes toward making powerful yet portable consoles, whereas others like the latest PlayStation and Xbox generations have proven yet again how powerful we can make little black boxes. In both cases (and PC gaming), companies are limited to the technology at hand, but graphics cards will continue to become more powerful, CPUs will become faster, and memory will continue to become cheaper. So, more powerful consoles/computers are cheaper. As for music technology, I’d venture those further evolutions of what we have now will be heavily leaning toward software rather than hardware.”

Conclusion
In 1978, rhythmic beeps and boops produced by a small sound chip took the world by storm. As time progressed, developers and musicians used the ever-changing technology to create sound and music that became mainstays in every household and arcade. Now that we’re taking advantage of real-time recordings of 100-piece symphony orchestras and software that can do pretty much anything, where will we be in the next 50 years?

e0f73091;2e95c100;;3c2385ee;;Music;;34324;"Music Games: Potential Application and Considerations for Rhythmic Training

Rhythmic skills are natural and widespread in the general population. The majority can track the beat of music and move along with it. These abilities are meaningful from a cognitive standpoint given their tight links with prominent motor and cognitive functions such as language and memory. When rhythmic skills are challenged by brain damage or neurodevelopmental disorders, remediation strategies based on rhythm can be considered. For example, rhythmic training can be used to improve motor performance (e.g., gait) as well as cognitive and language skills. Here, we review the games readily available in the market and assess whether they are well-suited for rhythmic training. Games that train rhythm skills may serve as useful tools for retraining motor and cognitive functions in patients with motor or neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, dyslexia, or ADHD). Our criteria were the peripheral used to capture and record the response, the type of response and the output measure. None of the existing games provides sufficient temporal precision in stimulus presentation and/or data acquisition. In addition, games do not train selectively rhythmic skills. Hence, the available music games, in their present form, are not satisfying for training rhythmic skills. Yet, some features such as the device used, the interface or the game scenario provide good indications for devising efficient training protocols. Guidelines are provided for devising serious music games targeting rhythmic training in the future.

Introduction
Musical Rhythm as a Training Tool
Humans display a natural tendency to move, spontaneously or deliberately, to the beat of rhythmic auditory stimuli, such as music (Repp, 2005; Repp and Su, 2013). This activity is widespread and is typically participatory. It manifests, for example, in dance, synchronized sport, and in group activities (e.g., waving together at a rock concert). Synchronization to a musical beat is sustained by a complex neuronal network, including perceptual regions (the superior temporal gyrus; Thaut, 2003; Chen et al., 2008a; Schwartze and Kotz, 2013), motor regions (e.g., the basal ganglia and the cerebellum; Grahn and Brett, 2007; Chen et al., 2008b; Grahn and Rowe, 2009), as well as sensorimotor integration areas (e.g., premotor cortex; Chen et al., 2006; Zatorre et al., 2007; Kornysheva and Schubotz, 2011). Disruption of these neuronal networks due to brain damage or neurodevelopmental disorder affects auditory-motor synchronization to a musical beat (Corriveau and Goswami, 2009; Bégel et al., 2017), as well as other functions such as speech. For example, difficulties encountered by individuals who stutter in speech production extend to non-verbal sensorimotor skills (Watkins et al., 2008; Falk et al., 2015). In speech production tasks, individual who stutter display reduced activity in brain regions that are also responsible for beat tracking and synchronization to a musical beat such as the basal ganglia (Civier et al., 2013), and the cerebellum (Brown et al., 2005).

Notably, tracking the beat does not require mandatorily an explicit motor response. In perceptual tasks, when detecting a deviation from the beat in an isochronous sequence (anisochrony detection; Ehrlé and Samson, 2005; Dalla Bella et al., 2017b), or detecting if a metronome is aligned or not to the beat (Beat Alignement Task, Iversen and Patel, 2008), the beat is extracted from the auditory signal to perform the judgment. Interestingly, beat extraction in the absence of an explicit motor response recruits motor regions of the brain, such as the basal ganglia (Grahn and Brett, 2007; Grahn and Rowe, 2009), or premotor cortex (Chen et al., 2008a,b). It is worth noting that processing sequences with an underlying beat engages partly separate mechanisms (beat-based timing), as compared to treating single durations (duration-based timing; Coull et al., 2011). The former rely on basal-ganglia-cortical mechanisms, while the latter are more associated to cerebellar-cortical pathways (Grube et al., 2010; Teki et al., 2011). For the purposes of this short review we focus in particular on the training of rhythmic skills engaging beat-based mechanisms.

Because mere listening to an auditory rhythm, for example conveyed via music, activates movement-related areas of the brain, training with rhythmic stimuli may be beneficial to (re)activate the motor system in the damaged and in the healthy brain. There are a few examples of the beneficial effects of rhythm on motor behavior. Rhythmic auditory stimulation can be used as a tool to retrain gait in Parkinson disease (e.g., for increasing speed and stride length; Thaut et al., 1996; Thaut and Abiru, 2010; Benoit et al., 2014; Dalla Bella et al., 2015, 2017a), to improve arm function in stroke (Thaut et al., 1997, 2002, 2007), or to enhance physical performance in sport (e.g., by reducing oxygen consumption in cycling; Hoffmann et al., 2012; Bardy et al., 2015). Positive effects of rhythmic training are not confined to motor behavior, but can extend to perception (Benoit et al., 2014; Dalla Bella et al., 2015). Stimulation using auditory rhythms shows promise also for training speech perception in children with Developmental Language Disorders (e.g., for syntax processing, Przybylski et al., 2013; Schön and Tillmann, 2015). In sum, previous studies point to beneficial effects of a rhythmic training protocol on movement and cognition. In addition, as rhythmic skills are linked to other cognitive abilities such as working memory and reading skills (Tierney and Kraus, 2013; Woodruff Carr et al., 2014), rhythmic training may foster improvements of more general cognitive abilities, which play a critical role in language learning and literacy (Schwartze and Kotz, 2013; Gordon et al., 2015; Kotz and Gunter, 2015). Ultimately, these beneficial effects of rhythmic training are likely to have positive consequences for health and well-being, such as promoting an active lifestyle, by reducing motor and cognitive decline in patient populations or reducing the need for healthcare services.

Serious Games
A great deal of work over the last two decades has been devoted to devise and promote games for training patients and for rehabilitation. This stream of research has been encouraged by low-cost and widespread new technologies offering unprecedented opportunities to implement training protocols. An increasing number of technologies are designed to improve health and well-being, from smartphone applications to control dietetics (Withings Wi-Fi Scales) to movement-based rehabilitation tools using motion capture (Zhou and Hu, 2008; Weiss et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2011). Among them, video games provide a way to entertain people while targeting serious goals, such as the rehabilitation of impaired movement skills (e.g., Hammer and Planks, Di Loreto et al., 2013; Nintendo Wii games, Saposnik et al., 2010) or cognitive re-entrainment (e.g., RehaCom, Fernández et al., 2012) in neurological diseases (for a review and classification of serious games in health, see Rego et al., 2010). In particular, movement-based rehabilitation games exploiting motion capture devices such as the Wii or the Kinect are a promising way to use technology in the context of re-education (for a review see Webster and Celik, 2014). This method is referred to as “Exergaming”. Note that video games for entertainment may also be used in a serious manner. For example, off-the-shelf video games are often used by physicians for therapeutic purposes, such as Nintendo Wii or Kinect games (Lange et al., 2009; Barry et al., 2014; Karahan et al., 2015). Exergaming has been proven as efficient in stroke (Webster and Celik, 2014), Parkinson’s disease (Harris et al., 2015), as well as in healthy elderly adults (Sun and Lee, 2013).

During the last 5 years, studies have focused on the cognitive and neuronal underpinnings of the benefits linked to health-targeted serious games (Connolly et al., 2012). On top of the physical and physiological benefits associated with serious games (e.g., via dedicated physiotherapeutic exercises), the effects of this type of training extend to cognition. Cognitive functions such as language and memory can also be enhanced by serious games, an effect which is likely to be accompanied by plastic changes of the brain. For example, structural brain changes associated with learning have been observed due to the use of videogames (Anguera et al., 2013). These promising results indicate that implementing training protocols via serious games may be particularly valuable for enhancing brain functions as well as for therapy and rehabilitation.

In summary, serious games and rhythmic stimulation are promising tools that can be exploited to improve or retrain movement and cognition. We propose that a training of rhythm skills implemented in a serious game would be a means to set up training protocols which may serve rehabilitation of different patient populations. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of the existing rhythm games and to assess whether they could be well-suited for training purposes. We conducted a survey in which we used criteria such as the precision of the recorded response or the modality of the stimuli provided to evaluate the benefits and limitations of each game.

Limits and Advantages of The Existing Rhythm Games
To the best of our knowledge, only one music-based training program that uses a game setting has been successfully devised for arm rehabilitation in stroke patients (Friedman et al., 2011, 2014). However, this protocol is not training rhythmic skills per se but is rather a music-based adaptation of a standard rehabilitation protocol (i.e., conventional tabletop exercises therapy; Dickstein et al., 1986). To examine whether existing games involving rhythm conveyed by auditory stimuli could be potentially used as training tools, we selected games based on the following inclusion criteria. First, the game has to focus on rhythmic skills. The player must be instructed to synchronize movement (or voice) with stimuli (auditory or visual) which can be predicted on the basis of their temporal structure (i.e., the underlying beat). To our knowledge, no rhythm games currently on the market use purely perceptual tasks, in which the player’s task is to judge the rhythmic features of music. All the games presented below involve movement synchronized to auditory or visual cues. Second, the game device must record the temporal precision of the player’s responses. The scores, levels, difficulty and feedback given to the player must depend on her/his temporal precision in performing the movement. Once the games were selected, they were categorized by: (a) the peripheral used to capture and record the response; (b) the type of response that is recorded; and (c) the output. The peripheral is important to judge if the game is readily usable for training (e.g., in a clinical context). In addition, note that most of the studies in cognitive psychology of rhythm use finger tapping, since this is a simple and objective way to study rhythmic skills (Repp, 2005; Repp and Su, 2013), but other reponses are possible (e.g., full-body motion). Finally, the output is relevant as it indicates whether the games provide a feedback (an outcome measure or score) on the precision of the performance reflecting a participant’s rhythmic skills. These categories are helpful for evaluating the therapeutic potential of each game. For example, a game requiring finger tapping is likely to have a different effect on behavior than a game requiring full body motion, such as dance.

Twenty-seven games on a variety of devices (Wii, PlayStation, PC, Tablet/Smartphone, Xbox, Gameboy) fulfilling the aforementioned criteria were considered for the analysis (see Table 1). These games were classified in four categories as indicated below.

TABLE 1
www.frontiersin.org
Table 1. List of the reviewed rhythm-based games.

Games that Involve Full Body Movements Recorded via an External Interface (e.g., Kinect, Wii)
Here we refer mostly to dance games (e.g., Just Dance). These games have interesting applications in physiotherapy for patients with spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury and stroke (Lange et al., 2009). They focus more on physical exercise and activity than on rhythm per se. Indeed, the ability of these games to record and score the rhythmic precision of the player is rather poor. Because these games focus on discrete movements/actions instead of repeated movements (i.e., rhythmic) they cannot be used for delivering specific training of rhythmic skills. For example, Just Dance consists in reproducing movements that are illustrated through images displayed on the screen. The player’s score depends on the precision of the movements as compared to a model action sequence. The player has to execute the movements in a given temporal window. Yet, the task is not purely rhythmic and synchronization to the musical beat is not recorded. In spite of the fact that these games do not measure rhythmic skills per se, they provide a motivating setting to perform dance while monitoring the player’s movements. Adding a rhythm component to some of these games, as in the case of dance, may be a valuable strategy to translate them into a training program.

Games that Involve Rhythmic Finger Tapping on a Tablet
An example of these games is Beat Sneak Bandit. Here, the player has to tap precisely to the beat in order to make the character progress, avoid the enemies and so forth. This kind of feature is used in serious games dedicated to learning, such as Rhythm Cat, designed to learn music rhythm notation. For the purposes of training rhythmic skills, one major drawback of these games is that the timing precision of the software is very poor. The time window in which a response is considered as good is very wide (i.e., up to several hundreds of milliseconds) and the temporal variability of the recording is high. In addition, no feedback on the rhythmic performance of the player is provided.

Computer or Console Games that Involve Finger Tapping on Keys
These games can be played on a keyboard, using a joystick, or on special devices. One of the most famous is Guitar Hero. In this game the player plays on a guitar replica with five keys, and has to push the keys in correspondence of images presented on a screen. Rhythm precision of the responses is recorded and used to compute a performance score. The response must appear in a specific temporal window to be considered as good. The same concept is used in many PC games, but keyboards key (e.g., arrows) are used instead of guitar replica. As in the case of tablet games, the main weakness of these games is their low temporal precision in recording rhythmic performance (around 100 ms in Guitar Hero). Nevertheless, these games are interesting as they represent a good starting point to develop serious-game applications aimed at training rhythmic skills.

Console Games Involving Singing
In these games, the player is asked to sing in synchrony with the music. This is not a rhythmic task per se, but the performance involves a rhythmic component. As in classical karaoke, lyrics are presented on the screen. In this case, a feedback (score) is provided to the player while she/he sings and a final global score is given at the end of the performance, including temporal precision (the response must appear in a given temporal window to be considered as good) but also pitch precision. Here, the potential benefit for health rests upon the fact that singing is a good way to restore speech abilities (e.g., fluency) in aphasia following stroke (for example, see Norton et al., 2009).

Even though some of the aforementioned games present good ground for training rhythmic skills, their main drawback is that their temporal precision when recording movement relative to the beat is rather poor. Thus, the output measures provided by these games are insufficient to isolate rhythmic features of the performance (e.g., variability of the motor performance, precision of the synchronization with the beat, etc.). Moreover, in none of these games the rhythmic complexity of musical stimuli has been manipulated. Difficulty is manipulated only through the amount of responses required during the game (e.g., number of visual tags which the player has to react to) which is not a rhythmical feature. For example, using music with various degrees of beat saliency would allow introducing rhythm-based difficulty levels in the game. This has the advantage that rhythms with increased complexity could be presented progressively throughout the game, thus potentially leading to improved beat-tracking skills.

Conclusion
We reviewed 27 rhythm-based games already in the market that could be used in a rhythmic training protocol. Unfortunately, based on our criteria, none of the aforementioned games is satisfying for this purpose. First, in most of the games, the task consists in reacting to visual stimulations while music is presented. Thus rhythmic skills are not selectively trained. Second, the number of stimuli, instead of the rhythmic characteristics of the music, is varied to change the difficulty of the game. Third, in spite of the fact that the regularity of rhythmic patterns can influence the performance in the game, the response provided by the player is not targeted at the rhythmic aspects of the stimuli. For example, the player touches the screen at the right moment to catch objects or makes full-body movements to imitate model-actions in dance games. In addition, note that the reviewed games do not offer opportunities for controlled functional movement training. For example, none of them provide a guidance to achieve desired movement trajectories. This problem may be overcome in the future by providing relevant feedback when the player approaches optimal movement trajectories (e.g., via sonification, Effenberg et al., 2016). The tasks implemented in these games are vaguely reminiscent of implicit timing tasks (Lee, 1976; Zelaznik et al., 2002; Coull and Nobre, 2008). Explicit and implicit timing have been treated as relatively independent processes in cognitive neuroscience (Zelaznik et al., 2002; Coull and Nobre, 2008; Coull et al., 2011). The former is associated with tasks requiring voluntary motor production (e.g., synchronized tapping tasks; Repp, 2005; Repp and Su, 2013) or overt estimation of stimulus duration (e.g., duration discrimination; Grondin, 1993). In contrast, implicit timing is tested with tasks unrelated to timing (e.g., avoiding a vehicle when crossing the road), but in which temporal prediction affects the performance (judging the time before the vehicle reaches us; Lee, 1976; for more details, see Nobre et al., 2007; Coull and Nobre, 2008; Coull, 2009). In particular, temporal prediction fostered by a regular temporal pattern (e.g., a metronome) of sensory stimuli improves performance in non-temporal tasks (e.g., working memory, Cutanda et al., 2015; pitch judgment, Jones et al., 2002; language judgments, Przybylski et al., 2013).";Music game as Rhythmic training;"- **Rhythmic Skills:**  Most people can naturally follow the beat of music.

Illustration: Jordan Moss
There’s magic in the air when someone expertly crushes a round of Dance Dance Revolution.
The music is distinct, a frantic blend of disco and happy hardcore, with stylish characters on-screen and bold lights and design framing the dance pad. The player, locked in a groove with the music, is rewarded for active listening and tight reflexes, responding to the music’s rhythms, movements, and melodies. Rhythm games demand your attention visually, sonically, and physically in a way that’s wholly unique to the art forms of both music and video games. A great rhythm game establishes its own distinct identity through visuals, music selection (whether original or compiled), and interaction.

At their core, the gameplay of these games has largely remained the same since 1996. A series of ‘notes’ fly toward you or appear in a sequence, and the player has to time their input to sync with the ‘notes’ that are timed with the music. However, that doesn’t mean that with each passing year, rhythm games haven’t found new ways to innovate within the world of interactive music experiences. Throughout their history, these games have continually pushed the envelope of what a game could be, and what the experience of music listening could look like, and they deserve to have a place within the upper echelon of interactive art forms.

The early days (1987 — 2004)
This particular combination of music and gameplay can be traced back to none other than Nintendo, with the release of Dance Aerobics in 1987. Dance Aerobics, part of a set of games designed around the Power Pad, was the first video game to combine music and now iconic timing-based gameplay. Marketed as a way to “Hop, skip, and jump your way into shape,” it was a simple game with simple music, but it created a template for the explosion of variety that would come ten years later.

1996 is the year that really kicked off the rhythm game boom, with Beatmania taking over arcades and PaRappa the Rapper taking over consoles. PaRappa the Rapper was an independently-produced hit. The gameplay was a refined version of Dance Aerobics: listen to a part of a song; watch the series of required inputs; mimic the inputs; advance through the song. Where PaRappa the Rapper exceeded, however, was in attitude and point-of-view (series creator Masaya Matsuura thought it was imperative for the game to have the capability for players to improvise and add their own ‘beats’ while they played). The game was packed with style, from the goofy original tracks to the distinct art direction to the iconic character design — PaRappa the Rapper was a major success in Japan and around the world.

Beatmania, developed by rhythm game pioneers Konami, was an entirely new gaming concept in its own right that blended real-time gameplay with a DJ booth-style control system and original tracks in a variety of genres ranging from hip hop to techno. The premise was simple: pick a song of your choice; match the inputs of that song in real-time with a controller; get a score; repeat. This template became a goldmine for Konami (and eventually others), and Beatmania is the franchise to thank for it. It even lead to the formation of a new subsidiary, Bemani, that would solely focus on music games moving forward.

Bemani further expanded on the genre with Guitarfreaks and Pop N’ Music in the years that followed, making way for the behemoth that is the Dance Dance Revolution series to debut in 1998. For those of you that haven’t laid eyes on DDR, it follows the same style of gameplay as the Beatmania games, except it focuses on ‘dancing’ to the music, using your feet as the controller rather than your hands. Dance Dance Revolution is one of the scarce examples of something with ‘revolution’ in the title that wasn’t hyperbole. This series was and continues to be absolutely massive, having a tremendous impact on gaming and popular culture. It was well-branded, had a near-perfect gameplay style that was simple but incredibly deep, and of course, had absolutely phenomenal music. In the 21-year history of the series, it has been released across 16 platforms and seen 17 mainline titles (and upwards of 100 spin-off games). The Dance Pad controller is iconic within the larger world of video games, with fans using the controller to beat games like Kingdom Hearts and Bloodborne to this day. There’s even a movie in the works as of 2018.

The early days of rhythm games post-DDR saw a plethora of eccentric games get released, both in the arcade and on consoles. Drummania replicated the peripheral-based gameplay of Beatmania and Guitarfreaks but focused on drumming, and was also the first game to introduce co-op performing (which would later take off with the Rock Band series). Karaoke Revolution and SingStar introduced singing-based rhythm games to home consoles across the globe. Peripherals for home console games were seeing more experimentation as well, with games like Donkey Konga and Samba de Amigo testing the limits of how out-there these games could get in terms of music and playstyles.

Beyond the world of peripherals and arcades, games like Space Channel 5 and Gitaroo Man found themselves with rabid cult fanbases due to their over-the-top art direction and storytelling. Even the classical genre got its own game in the form of Mad Maestro. Clearly, there seemed to be no shortage of innovation happening in the space, especially amongst Japanese development teams. However, amongst these Japanese success stories, a small, then nearly unknown American company called Harmonix quietly released two games — FreQuency in 2001 and Amplitude in 2003 — that slowly built dedicated followings, leading them to bring about the next phase of the rhythm game boom.

American innovations (2005 — 2010)
Although FreQuency and Amplitude garnered critical success and even a handful of awards, the games did not fare as well when it came to sales. However, these early titles put Harmonix on the radar of none other than Konami, who approached the team to develop Karaoke Revolution. This was Harmonix’s big break, and showed them that their games did in fact have the potential for widespread commercial success. With the combined experiences of developing their own avant-garde titles and working with a major corporation on a mainstream hit, Harmonix were in a near-perfect position when RedOctane approached them with an industry-changing idea in 2004. Guitar Hero, with a RedOctane-designed guitar controller and expertly-crafted gameplay from Harmonix, made its release in 2005. After Harmonix was acquired by MTV, Rock Band followed in 2007 and the rhythm game boom was upon the US market. Excluding the underperforming 2015 reboot, the Guitar Hero franchise grossed over $2 billion dollars in its heyday, something that only legacy franchises Madden and Super Mario had been able to achieve at the time. Rock Band, with its variety of gameplay styles and focus on original, licensed music, saw its own share of success, reaching $1 billion dollars in revenue in a short 15 months.

Building on what Harmonix had learned in their early years, these games were designed to be accessible by the non-gamer, which undoubtedly contributed to their staggering success. Sure, Konami had basically come up with the same idea a number of years prior (they even sued Harmonix and eventually settled out of court over it), but Harmonix was shrewd in bringing that gameplay out of arcades and into the homes of gamers and (most importantly) non-games alike. Both franchises also clearly understood the importance of including popular music in their games, making the premise even easier to understand for those who were unfamiliar with video games.

Where these games truly succeeded, though, was in capturing the magic of performance for American audiences. There’s always been some kind of debate around these games and how they may influence people to pick up the ‘real thing,’ whether it’s learning how to dance, play guitar, et cetera. Yet, that viewpoint is at odds with the fact that playing these games are their own performance. The act of performing for friends, strangers, or yourself is clearly its own reward, and Harmonix (and their Japanese counterparts) understood that deeply.

The astronomical success these games experienced right out of the gate may have also been a warning sign that these heights were not sustainable. By 2010, after countless spin-offs and sequels, both franchises went on hiatus. There were simply too many variations of the same concept, too many peripheral units starting to gather dust, and too little in the way of innovation since 2005. It wasn’t to say that the genre ‘died’ in 2010; these franchises merely settled back into more regular sales numbers. Although these games had captured a massive portion of the market and the culture at large, there were still all kinds of weird rhythm games released in the latter half of the 2000s that were continuing to innovate and find new ways for players to interact with music. Mobile rhythm games had begun to take off, as did more gesture-based games with the rise of motion capture technology — two advancements that signaled what the future of the genre was going to look like.

The present and future of rhythm games (2010 — present)
Since the start of the 2010s, rhythm games have continued to embrace new technologies while also offering more specialized and stylized experiences (a path that was so popular back in the early 2000s). With the explosion of indie gaming in the early part of the decade, a ton of new ideas have been brought to the table. In addition, major studios (in Asia in particular) have been continuing to introduce all kinds of innovative ideas to the market. Mobile games like Cytus, Tap Tap Revenge, and Groove Coaster have grown into major franchises, capitalizing on the pervasiveness of smartphones. Motion capture-based games like Just Dance have grown into wildly profitable global franchises with annual release cycles as if they were AAA sports franchises. Indie games like Thumper and Sayonara Wild Hearts have taken a more traditional approach while cranking up the art direction to 11 with highly imaginative visual universes and musical palettes. Beat Saber, one of the most successful VR rhythm games, has become ubiquitous within the genre, and inspired a whole new world of rhythm action games that combine gameplay styles. Idol-related rhythm games are practically their own genre at this point, with too many spin-offs, sequels, and tie-ins to easily name. Arcade games like Dance Rush Stardom have shown how new technologies can improve upon time-tested formulas to create even more engaging dancing simulators.

At their core, rhythm games are a celebration of everything that makes music so powerful. They capture the spirit of a performance, they celebrate the design and art direction of music, and they understand that a communal music experience is the best music experience. These games know that every person can, with a little guidance, feel like a pop star, or a dancer, or a lead singer, and that experience of feeling nothing but the music and the joy of performing has had — and will continue to have — a major impact on industry and culture.";History of rhythm game;"**Rhythm Games Overview:**  Rhythm games combine **music** and **interactive gameplay**, rewarding players for timing and reflexes.

The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism by F. T. Marinetti
We had stayed up all night, my friends and I, under hanging mosque lamps with domes of filigreed brass, domes starred like our spirits, shining like them with the prisoned radiance of electric hearts. For hours we had trampled our atavistic ennui into rich oriental rugs, arguing up to the last confines of logic and blackening many reams of paper with our frenzied scribbling.

An immense pride was buoying us up, because we felt ourselves alone at that hour, alone, awake, and on our feet, like proud beacons or forward sentries against an army of hostile stars glaring down at us from their celestial encampments. Alone with stokers feeding the hellish fires of great ships, alone with the black spectres who grope in the red-hot bellies of locomotives launched on their crazy courses, alone with drunkards reeling like wounded birds along the city walls.

Suddenly we jumped, hearing the mighty noise of the huge double-decker trams that rumbled by outside, ablaze with colored lights, like villages on holiday suddenly struck and uprooted by the flooding Po and dragged over falls and through gourges to the sea.

Then the silence deepened. But, as we listened to the old canal muttering its feeble prayers and the creaking bones of sickly palaces above their damp green beards, under the windows we suddenly heard the famished roar of automobiles.

‘Let’s go!’ I said. ‘Friends, away! Let’s go! Mythology and the Mystic Ideal are defeated at last. We’re about to see the Centaur’s birth and, soon after, the first flight of Angels!… We must shake at the gates of life, test the bolts and hinges. Let’s go! Look there, on the earth, the very first dawn! There’s nothing to match the splendor of the sun’s red sword, slashing for the first time through our millennial gloom!’

We went up to the three snorting beasts, to lay amorous hands on their torrid breasts. I stretched out on my car like a corpse on its bier, but revived at once under the steering wheel, a guillotine blade that threatened my stomach.

The raging broom of madness swept us out of ourselves and drove us through streets as rough and deep as the beds of torrents. Here and there, sick lamplight through window glass taught us to distrust the deceitful mathematics of our perishing eyes.

I cried, ‘The scent, the scent alone is enough for our beasts.’

And like young lions we ran after Death, its dark pelt blotched with pale crosses as it escaped down the vast violet living and throbbing sky.

But we had no ideal Mistress raising her divine form to the clouds, nor any cruel Queen to whom to offer our bodies, twisted like Byzantine rings! There was nothing to make us wish for death, unless the wish to be free at last from the weight of our courage!

And on we raced, hurling watchdogs against doorsteps, curling them under our burning tires like collars under a flatiron. Death, domesticated, met me at every turn, gracefully holding out a paw, or once in a while hunkering down, making velvety caressing eyes at me from every puddle.

‘Let’s break out of the horrible shell of wisdom and throw ourselves like pride-ripened fruit into the wide, contorted mouth of the wind! Let’s give ourselves utterly to the Unknown, not in desperation but only to replenish the deep wells of the Absurd!’

The words were scarcely out of my mouth when I spun my car around with the frenzy of a dog trying to bite its tail, and there, suddenly, were two cyclists coming towards me, shaking their fists, wobbling like two equally convincing but nevertheless contradictory arguments. Their stupid dilemma was blocking my way—Damn! Ouch!… I stopped short and to my disgust rolled over into a ditch with my wheels in the air…

O maternal ditch, almost full of muddy water! Fair factory drain! I gulped down your nourishing sludge; and I remembered the blessed black breast of my Sudanese nurse… When I came up—torn, filthy, and stinking—from under the capsized car, I felt the white-hot iron of joy deliciously pass through my heart!

A crowd of fishermen with handlines and gouty naturalists were already swarming around the prodigy. With patient, loving care those people rigged a tall derrick and iron grapnels to fish out my car, like a big beached shark. Up it came from the ditch, slowly, leaving in the bottom, like scales, its heavy framework of good sense and its soft upholstery of comfort.

They thought it was dead, my beautiful shark, but a caress from me was enough to revive it; and there it was, alive again, running on its powerful fins!

And so, faces smeared with good factory muck—plastered with metallic waste, with senseless sweat, with celestial soot—we, bruised, our arms in slings, but unafraid, declared our high intentions to all the living of the earth:

MANIFESTO OF FUTURISM

We intend to sing the love of danger, the habit of energy and fearlessness.
Courage, audacity, and revolt will be essential elements of our poetry.
Up to now literature has exalted a pensive immobility, ecstasy, and sleep. We intend to exalt aggressive action, a feverish insomnia, the racer’s stride, the mortal leap, the punch and the slap.
We affirm that the world’s magnificence has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing car whose hood is adorned with great pipes, like serpents of explosive breath—a roaring car that seems to ride on grapeshot is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace.
We want to hymn the man at the wheel, who hurls the lance of his spirit across the Earth, along the circle of its orbit.
The poet must spend himself with ardor, splendor, and generosity, to swell the enthusiastic fervor of the primordial elements.
Except in struggle, there is no more beauty. No work without an aggressive character can be a masterpiece. Poetry must be conceived as a violent attack on unknown forces, to reduce and prostrate them before man.
We stand on the last promontory of the centuries!… Why should we look back, when what we want is to break down the mysterious doors of the Impossible? Time and Space died yesterday. We already live in the absolute, because we have created eternal, omnipresent speed.
We will glorify war—the world’s only hygiene—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman.
We will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind, will fight moralism, feminism, every opportunistic or utilitarian cowardice.
We will sing of great crowds excited by work, by pleasure, and by riot; we will sing of the multicolored, polyphonic tides of revolution in the modern capitals; we will sing of the vibrant nightly fervor of arsenals and shipyards blazing with violent electric moons; greedy railway stations that devour smoke-plumed serpents; factories hung on clouds by the crooked lines of their smoke; bridges that stride the rivers like giant gymnasts, flashing in the sun with a glitter of knives; adventurous steamers that sniff the horizon; deep-chested locomotives whose wheels paw the tracks like the hooves of enormous steel horses bridled by tubing; and the sleek flight of planes whose propellers chatter in the wind like banners and seem to cheer like an enthusiastic crowd.
It is from Italy that we launch through the world this violently upsetting incendiary manifesto of ours. With it, today, we establish Futurism, because we want to free this land from its smelly gangrene of professors, archaeologists, ciceroni and antiquarians. For too long has Italy been a dealer in second-hand clothes. We mean to free her from the numberless museums that cover her like so many graveyards.

Museums: cemeteries!… Identical, surely, in the sinister promiscuity of so many bodies unknown to one another. Museums: public dormitories where one lies forever beside hated or unknown beings. Museums: absurd abattoirs of painters and sculptors ferociously slaughtering each other with color-blows and line-blows, the length of the fought-over walls!

That one should make an annual pilgrimage, just as one goes to the graveyard on All Souls’ Day—that I grant. That once a year one should leave a floral tribute beneath the Gioconda, I grant you that… But I don’t admit that our sorrows, our fragile courage, our morbid restlessness should be given a daily conducted tour through the museums. Why poison ourselves? Why rot?

And what is there to see in an old picture except the laborious contortions of an artist throwing himself against the barriers that thwart his desire to express his dream completely?… Admiring an old picture is the same as pouring our sensibility into a funerary urn instead of hurtling it far off, in violent spasms of action and creation.

Do you, then, wish to waste all your best powers in this eternal and futile worship of the past, from which you emerge fatally exhausted, shrunken, beaten down?

In truth I tell you that daily visits to museums, libraries, and academies (cemeteries of empty exertion, Calvaries of crucified dreams, registries of aborted beginnings!) are, for artists, as damaging as the prolonged supervision by parents of certain young people drunk with their talent and their ambitious wills. When the future is barred to them, the admirable past may be a solace for the ills of the moribund, the sickly, the prisoner… But we want no part of it, the past, we the young and strong Futurists!

So let them come, the gay incendiaries with charred fingers! Here they are! Here they are!… Come on! Set fire to the library shelves! Turn aside the canals to flood the museums!… Oh, the joy of seeing the glorious old canvases bobbing adrift on those waters, discolored and shredded!… Take up your pickaxes, your axes and hammers and wreck, wreck the venerable cities, pitilessly!

The oldest of us is thirty: so we have at least a decade for finishing our work. When we are forty, other younger and stronger men will probably throw us in the wastebasket like useless manuscripts—we want it to happen!

They will come against us, our successors, will come from far away, from every quarter, dancing to the winged cadence of their first songs, flexing the hooked claws of predators, sniffing doglike at the academy doors the strong odor of our decaying minds, which will have already been promised to the literary catacombs.

But we won’t be there… At last they’ll find us—one winter’s night—in open country, beneath a sad roof drummed by a monotonous rain. They’ll see us crouched beside our trembling aeroplanes in the act of warming our hands at the poor little blaze that our books of today will give out when they take fire from the flight of our images.

They’ll storm around us, panting with scorn and anguish, and all of them, exasperated by our proud daring, will hurtle to kill us, driven by a hatred the more implacable the more their hearts will be drunk with love and admiration for us.

Injustice, strong and sane, will break out radiantly in their eyes.

Art, in fact, can be nothing but violence, cruelty, and injustice.

The oldest of us is thirty: even so we have already scattered treasures, a thousand treasures of force, love, courage, astuteness, and raw will-power; have thrown them impatiently away, with fury, carelessly, unhesitatingly, breathless, and unresting… Look at us! We are still untired! Our hearts know no weariness because they are fed with fire, hatred, and speed!… Does that amaze you?

It should, because you can never remember having lived! Erect on the summit of the world, once again we hurl our defiance at the stars!

You have objections?—Enough! Enough! We know them… We’ve understood!… Our fine deceitful intelligence tells us that we are the revival and extension of our ancestors—Perhaps!… If only it were so!—But who cares? We don’t want to understand!… Woe to anyone who says those infamous words to us again!";"The term ""Futurism""";"**Futurism Manifesto:**  Written by **F. T.

More details
In 1910, Giacomo Balla and four fellow Italian artists—Umberto Boccioni (1882–1916), Carlo Carrà, Luigi Russolo (1885–1947), and Gino Severini—wrote La Pittura futurista: Manifesto tecnico (The Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painters). In this document they rejected all previous art as prosaic. A key tenet of their philosophy was that creative expression should represent the dynamism of the early 20th century’s fast-paced Industrial Age. They declared, “All things move, all things run, all things are rapidly changing. . . . moving objects constantly multiply themselves . . . a running horse has not four legs, but twenty.” This sentiment is reflected in both the title and the composition of Dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio (Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash). 

Balla painted this amusing study of a skittering dachshund and the staccato steps of his or her owner in May 1912 while visiting one of his students, the Contessa Nerazzini, at Montepulciano, near Siena. The lively background, with its vibrating and contrasting streaks of pink and green, is said to represent the white dust of the Tuscan countryside shimmering under the bright summer sun. The feet of the woman, the leash, and the dog’s body from nose to tail are all blurred and repeated. To enhance the impression of speed, Balla painted the ground using diagonal lines and placed his signature and the date at a dynamic angle.

The term afrofuturism has its origins in African-American science fiction. Today it is generally used to refer to literature, music and visual art that explores the African-American experience and in particular the role of slavery in that experience.

Central to the concept of afrofuturism are the science-fiction writers Octavia Butler and Samuel R. Delany and the Jazz musician Sun Ra, who created a mythical persona that merged science fiction with Egyptian mysticism. It is this otherness that is at the heart of afrofuturism.

Those inspired by afrofuturism include the musician George Clinton, the artist Ellen Gallagher and the film director Wanuri Kahiu.";Afrofuturism;"**Definition:**  **Afrofuturism** is a cultural style that mixes **science fiction**, **history**, and **fantasy** to explore the **African-American experience**.

From the moment of its inception, the genre has been concerned with the promise and peril of breaking from modernity

The body of work loosely contained under the label of Afrofuturism exists within two radically distinct but conceptually overlapping timelines. The first encompasses the history of the United States but focuses its attention on slavery and its aftermath, traced all the way into the current century – the longue durée. Consider the paintings assembled for the recently opened In the Black Fantastic exhibition at London’s Hayward Gallery. Ellen Gallagher’s canvases, depictions of survivors of the Middle Passage – thrown overboard but living in technologically advanced cities beneath the surface – represent the more radical wing of this first approach.

The second extends its focus further still. It exists in cosmic time, beginning in the mythical pre-historic past and reaching out into the far-flung future. Between these two points – in place of the events which have created the world of the present day: capitalism, colonialism, the emergence of the nation state – there is usually a void, and we are instead given a timeline that jumps back and forth between pyramids and spaceships. For instance, Chris Ofili fuses Homeric and religious myth with celestial fantasies about contact with alien lifeforms. In his sculpture Annunciation (2006) – featured in In the Black Fantastic – a golden Mary and a black pregnant Gabriel (more alien than angel) press their naked bodies up against one another.

Both approaches respond to the problem of whether it is possible to imagine something like a black modernity. Standing in the way is the existence of actual modernity, whose defining features the genre usually understands to be racism and slavery (but also, as in the images of greed and consumption in Wangechi Mutu’s animation The End of eating Everything, 2013, the destruction of the environment).

Coined by cultural critic Mark Dery in his 1994 essay ‘Black to the Future’, Afrofuturism from the moment of its inception was concerned with understanding how it was possible to enact a break from modernity by imagining what Dery called ‘possible futures’, or paths not taken, as an alternative to our present world which is so saturated with suffering that little within it seems salvageable. There are of course other visions of the future but these are, Dery insisted, ‘owned by technocrats, futurologists, streamliners and set-designers’ – a grouping which is ‘white to a man’. The cultural critic’s immediate focus was on fiction – turning to sci-fi novelist Samuel R. Delany or the DC Comics superhero Icon – but the problems emerging from this medium were present across artforms.

An instructive intervention came from the critic Greg Tate, writing in 1992, who took issue with the erasure of what he called the ‘affirmative aspects of blackness’ in Delany’s novels. Pushing back against such criticism, Delany insisted that part of what it meant to imagine something beyond modernity was to abandon the idea that one had to fight ‘the fragmentation and multicultural diversity of the world […] by constructing something so rigid as an identity’.

At his best, Delany is able to present social identities and structures as subordinate to technology and chance which he uses to explain how this fragmentation occurs in practice. In ‘The Star Pit’, a story from 1965, he describes how the first manned inter-galactic voyage became possible: ‘Through some freakish accident, two people had been discovered who didn’t crack up at twenty thousand light years off the galactic rim, who didn’t die at twenty-five thousand.’

Inhabitants of Delany’s world entertain emptying the asylums in search of other psychological freaks capable of galactic travel, but to no avail; the chosen are not marked out by features that overlap with any socially recognizable categories. Rather, technology and chance create these classifications. Where this flight into fantasy leaves the identity of race is left deliberately unclear. In this mode, Afrofuturism seeks merely to leapfrog the present, making our own social categories appear alien in the process.

Writing in 2003, the filmmaker and theorist Kodwo Eshun described Afrofuturism as a ‘program for recovering the histories of counter-futures’, a description which gets at both the power and limitations of the genre. What is lost? Through its often-totalizing understanding of actual history as endless suffering, the genre, in attempting to break with European modernity, breaks instead with the radicalism of actually-existing black modernism. In its worst instantiations, invocations of ideas about transcending all social, sexual and racial categories can often come across as cheap mysticism, reliant on supposed connections between black people and a mythic regal past that is alarmingly similar to the ideology of European fascism. This is a tendency to which Afrofuturism in its more celebratory modes falls victim. 

Of course, to engage with this oeuvre in such an argumentative way might be to miss the point. All artists rely in some sense on fundamental delusions or misrepresentations as a springboard. The important question should therefore be, what formal innovations does this playful space open up? Here the symbols of royalty, of pre-modern notions of a harmony with nature, of an inherent black spirituality are so well worn that it is difficult to imagine how one could turn to these themes without relying on cliché.

One reason for this might be the fact that Afrofuturism within the visual arts exists within the same representational world as mass-produced popular culture. (The artist Lina Iris Viktor, exhibited at the Hayward, once filed a lawsuit against Kendrick Lamar for allegedly appropriating her work in the music video for the rapper’s Black Panther soundtrack song.) The further Afrofuturism has been able to move from this market-dominated vision of culture, the more autonomously it has been able to think about the future. Much of the more interesting work assembled within the Hayward’s exhibition, such as Hew Locke’s sculptures and Kara Walker’s film recreations of racist violence, avoids these cheap solutions. They preoccupy themselves with the work of facing the future with two feet planted firmly in the present, interpreting the complex forms of identity taking shape in the here and now. In doing so, they point forward towards a more possible future.";The Past and Future of Afrofuturism;"- **Definition of Afrofuturism:**  Afrofuturism combines **African culture** with **science fiction**, art, and technology to envision a future that reflects black experiences.

“Entire nations are built on fairytales,” states the character Dunia, responding to Alia in a conversation about memory and the past in Larissa Sansour’s In Vitro. This two-channel film is part of her presentation Heirloom for the Danish Pavilion at the 58th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia, curated by Nat Muller.

Heirloom also includes the mixed media installation with soundscape Monument for Lost Time, which is encountered in a room across from the film projection. The enormous sculpture of an ominous black sphere, with surround synthesized sound, dwarfs the visitors to the pavilion and reflects back to images seen in the film—science fiction infiltrating the real. However, it is the narrative of this world underground that explores nostalgic memories and hope of a future rebuilt.

The black and white film opens with a wave of black oil rushing through the streets of Bethlehem. It encapsulates a sensation of destruction of all the blood lost and memories washed away. Along with transitions between archival footage and the narrative past of the character Dunia, we cannot forget the events of Bethlehem’s complex and turbulent history. The story is set after an ecological disaster of Bethlehem and life living underground—embedding its metaphor for a life suppressed but safeguarded from threat, while the Palestinian city can be reconstructed or restored. We see an orchard being replanted, cloning from the seeds that remained.

The film’s title clues the viewer that the character has been made, and in fact a clone from remaining DNA after the disaster. Alia, the young clone of the scientist Dunia, argues with her about the lived and recollected experience. Dunia lays in her death bed dreaming to return to a past or her home rebuilt. We experience memories that Dunia clings to along with those that are collective and archived through the cloned existence of Alia. As a clone, memories have been implanted, and Alia carries the experience of others of a place bygone. As a new place rebuilds, Alia has a strong will for her own identity and experiences rather than the ones she inherited.

The question of memory is brought to task and questions the necessity and the impact of nostalgia. Where does an individual’s memory begin and when is it reinvented by the stories of others? Dunia argues how “We were all raised on someone else’s nostalgia.” Yet Alia states, “The problem with nostalgia is that it keeps you entertained...” and continues “...while everything you cherish washes away.” Deafened by the past and questioning the building of the future, inherited trauma, along with the role that memories play, weave throughout the scenes. As time navigates from past to future in the film, charged with ownership, heritage, as well as exile, it raises questions: whether the erasure of memory and the neglecting of clinging to nostalgia would be better for the future, or whether memories are necessary to avoid future mistakes and the construction of a new identity.

Heirloom, and in particular In Vitro, provides no immediate consolation for the future in face of disaster, but hovers the notions of memory both its potential prospect and hinderance for new beginnings.";Could an artist be 'Asiafuturist';"**Film Title:**  *In Vitro* (2019) by **Larissa Sansour** and **Søren Lind**.

So. Storytime for guerilla gardeners and solarpunk enthusiasts. This story comes to me 3rd hand but I believe the basic shape of it is true, even if details may be off.

So there’s this guy who lives in my parents’ town. Wanted to have a pocket farm but lives on an urban lot in a small city instead because y’know jobs and stuff. He could definitely get a few raised beds in the backyard but nothing all that impressive and the front yard is on a very busy road with the expectation that it’ll look reasonably traditional (plus planting food by busy roads isn’t always a good idea).

However

After he’s lived there for a while, he realizes his neighbors are all older people who maybe have more challenges taking care of their yards than they used to. So he goes to his next door neighbor and offers a deal: I’ll mow and maintain your front yard for free if you let me knock down the fences between our backyards and plant them both with food. And you’ll get a cut of the produce.

Presumably the neighbor already knew and trusted this guy because he said yes. So he starts mowing and maintaining his and his neighbor’s front yards and planting food in their now-shared backyards. After a season or two this goes well enough that the next neighbor down the street asks if he can be in on this too.

So now there’s 3 front yards to mow and three backyards full of produce. And it keeps going from there. Dude gets a rider lawnmower and does everyone’s front yards, and meanwhile he’s maintaining an entire block’s worth of produce in the back. His yields got so high that he was able to start offering boxes of produce outside of the block’s residents too. This is how I heard of him: my parents’ next door neighbors were picking up a regular box of produce from him.

I love a couple of things about this story:

Offering to maintain people’s front yards for them allows baby boomers to feed their thirst for keeping up appearances while still getting food production into the neighborhood
As homeowners age offering services like this is legitimately good community building
BLOCK-LONG POCKET FARM
These exact circumstances might not be replicable everywhere, but I love thinking about how these principles could be applied.

This is the way!

SimCity 2000
SimCity 2000 features 4 arcologies. They are available once the player reaches a population of 120,000 Sims and once the player is in the year when they are invented. They have a rating from F to A+.

Plymouth Arcology
SC2 Plymouth Arcology
Plymouth arcology

""The Plymouth Arco is ""Solid as a Rock"", or so claims Plymouth Arcologies, Inc. It is known that they have stood through several earthquakes, notably in the NeoRepublic of Mexico and the Taiwan CoProsperity Region. Plymouth Arcologies are designed primarily to support heavy industries, as witness Greenland Motors, maker of the Narwhal 3000. This might not be such a good choice if you are overly concerned about pollution.""
— in-game info
Available at around the year 2000. Price $100,000. Holds 55,000 residents. The only arcology to emit mild pollution into the atmosphere.

Forest Arcology

Forest arcology

""The Forest Arcology is named for its attractive forest setting on the top level. Throughout the structure, citizens utilize recycling, operate ecologically sound industries, and maintain a rich verbal heritage that replaces television and radio. Unfortunately, the youth of Forest Arcos are bored silly and roam out into your city where they stare mindlessly at soap operas and sports programs displayed in the electronics department at local malls.""
— in-game info
Available at around the year 2050. Price $120,000. Holds 30,000 residents.

Darco Arcology
SC2 Darco Arcology
Darco arcology

""'Darco' is slang for ""De-Urbanized Arcological Construct"". Originally designed by the twisted genius of Dante McCallavre, the artist/architect proclaimed it a reactionary response to the rigid, archetypal Arcologies of his day. No one really knows what this means, and many engineers are frankly baffled at how the thing stays standing. Inside, the ill-lit corridor's twist into odd, meandering corkscrews that mysteriously turn back on themselves. There are rumors that a strange sub-species of man inhabits the air ducts.""
— in-game info
Available at around the year 2100. Darcos cost $150,000 and can attract up to 45,000 brave souls.

Launch Arcology
Launch Arcology
A launch arco, the most expensive and populous arcology design in SimCity 2000.

""'Launch' Arcologies were nicknamed for their resemblance to modern orbital launchers. The resemblance is not entirely coincidental, as sophisticated methods of biological support were necessary to oxygenate and feed the thousands of inhabitants. While never tested, the manufacturers claim the occupants could stay self-contained for up to two decades. The sides of the Arcology are equipped with vernier jets to stabilize the structure during storms and earthquakes. A small nuclear facility independently powers the building; spare energy is stored by electrolyzing water into two tanks for oxygen and hydrogen.""
— in-game info
Available at around the year 2150. The 'Launch Arco' is the largest, costing $200,000 and holding 65,000 inhabitants.

Launch Arco Trick
The Launch arco trick can be done in the DOS & Mac v1.1 and also Window version of SimCity 2000. After building 301 launch arcos, and after the year 2051, a message will appear saying, ""The exodus has begun."" The arcos will appear to explode one by one, taking over two minutes to complete, and the game will show another message, ""Your launch arcos have departed into space to find new worlds. You have been compensated for the construction.""

Concept art of the SimCity 3000 version of the Plymouth Arco.

SimCity 3000 originally planned to feature arcologies, but they were cut at some point in development. The only confirmed traces of their existence is an unused audio file found in the sounds folder and two pieces of concept art for the Plymouth and Darco arcologies.

Based off what little information there is, they likely would have been similar to their SimCity 2000 counterparts, based on footprint and capacity, but the effects on the cities they are built in would have had much wider range considering SimCity 3000 is a more advanced simulation.

Arcologies were likely cut in favor of dense 4x4 zoned buildings and more specialized reward buildings like the Spaceport.

SimCity Creator (DS)
In SimCity Creator for Nintendo DS, arcologies will appear in the post global warming age. They are similar to the ones in SimCity 2000.

SimCity (2013)

Arcology in SimCity (2013)

Arcologies make a return in the form of a great work in the SimCity reboot. Like other great works, multiple cities in a region can work together to complete the structure. Once a city in the region reaches 58,000 residents, the construction of the arcology is unlocked, and the region then needs to collect a million simoleons, 2,800 tons of metal, 1,000 tons of alloy and 60,000 crates of televisions.

The upkeep is 300 simoleons per hour.

The Launch Arcology returns as a landmark in the SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow expansion. It is available by pre-ordering the expansion. The building is placed under the Tourism tab of the City Specializations. Upon plopping down the structure in one's city, tourists and prisoners will begin settling into the edifice. After 5,000 spots are filled, the player is given the option to launch the Arcology into deep space. Upon launch, the player would be rewarded a large sum of cash from the 'ticket sales' of the landmark.

Will Solarpunk’s over-reliance on an architectural aesthetic be the demise of the movement’s ecological philosophy?

If you’ve spent some time in online architectural forums recently, maybe you’ve stumbled upon images of “Solarpunk architecture.” Generally characterized by grand, swooping biophilic structures replete with vertical forests and solar panels, and in which people live in happy harmony with nature, these renderings evoke a utopian future that might be mistaken for science fiction. But the impressive graphics belie a serious political and social movement intent on taking architecture into a radically greener, more sustainable direction.

Solarpunk architecture fits into the broader Solarpunk movement, which first emerged on Reddit in 2008 as an aesthetic and literary response to Cyberpunk and has grown rapidly in popularity since the mid-2010s. Whereas Cyberpunk has long envisioned a dystopian future rife with urban decay, techno-authoritarian rule and inescapable pollution, Solarpunk sees the future in much more optimistic terms.

Solarpunk visualizes a world detached from capitalist incentives, where humans use high tech and low tech in equal measures as tools for social and economic equality, and urban environments are designed to restore natural ecosystems threatened by climate change. Projects by architects like Vincent Callebaut, a judge for Architizer’s One Rendering Competition, Luc Schuiten and, more recently, by AI-generated images have pushed these ideas into the mainstream, demonstrating the potential Solarpunk has as a legitimate architectural movement.

The ideas supporting Solarpunk might not be as far-fetched as they seem. Much in the same way that Brutalism was a clean break from architectural tradition, Solarpunk seeks to promote a drastically different approach to the architecture of the 21st century. It argues that the architectural styles of today — the ubiquitous, gleaming, sleek, minimalist towers of steel and glass, for instance — have either failed to address the climactic threats to our planet or have made things worse. Recognizing that our current ways of building are fundamentally an existential threat demands a radical new architectural philosophy, which Solarpunk seems to offer.

It’s difficult to evaluate an architectural movement that exists almost entirely in conceptual terms. At present, the closest thing stylistically to Solarpunk architecture might be Singapore’s Garden City: a political initiative introduced by Lee Kuan Yew in 1967 to transform the dense city into an urban environment brimming with greenery. In recent years, Singaporean architecture has produced dozens of stunning projects evoking the Solarpunk ethos: the Supertree Groves, the Cloud Fountain, the Jewel Changi Airport and the Marina Bay Sands are but a few prominent examples. Such projects regularly make waves on the Solarpunk Reddit to varying degrees of approval, and some Redditors have offered mitigated praise for the city with the slogan: “Singapore minus cars = Solarpunk”.

The data seems to support the ecological benefits of such architecture. Singapore regularly ranks in the top 10 greenest cities in the world. The city has greatly benefitted from the increased presence of nature in the city, reducing urban heat island effect, improving water management and increasing biodiversity, among other things.

Yet it’s not so much the Singapore’s high-rising biophilic green towers or indoor waterfalls replete with lush jungles that contribute to the city’s green credentials. It’s instead the city’s half-century long list of green policies that do most of the heavy lifting. Singapore’s Green Plan 2030, for instance, sets goals like setting aside 50% more land for green spaces and planting one million more trees throughout the city over the next decade. These initiatives are perhaps less visually arresting than designing a vertical jungle on a new skyscraper, but they do much more to bring the city closer to its sustainability goals. As for Singapore’s Solarpunk-like projects, they are more a symbol of the city’s environmental successes than a significant contributor to them.

Therein lies the biggest pitfall of Solarpunk. The movement risks being whittled down to an aesthetic dimension, which in turn will undermine its own ecological philosophy. Solarpunk risks becoming a style without principles; a “green” architecture without green policies. Worse still, the movement could easily be co-opted by developers eager on giving the impression that their projects are environmentally sustainable while they continue to rely to carbon-emitting materials and energy-intensive design principles.

As one Redditor put it more bluntly: “We need more emphasis on the “punk” part of Solarpunk. Next thing you know, some fortune 500 company [sic] will latch on to the Solarpunk theme, and turn it into “SolarPop” or some other greenwashed bullshit.” There is also an irony to the fact that most renderings visualizing Solarpunk architecture could only ever be realistically undertaken by the world’s wealthiest countries and corporations.

For Solarpunk to become a viable architectural movement, it must start by relying less on its futuristic visual aesthetic. Though the Solarpunk aesthetic of today is certainly inspiring and evokes an optimistic vision of the future, it can easily turn into a cynical one if the style becomes appropriated by the very capitalistic interests the movement criticizes. Solarpunks should instead put more focus on the grassroots; this includes promoting local environmental policies and incentivizing smaller-scale projects in which individuals — rather than governments or big corporations — can take part. The results should center on the ecological footprint of such initiatives, regardless of whether the final product is pleasing to the eye or looks futuristic.

The movement could also engage with cutting-edge research into green technologies that complement the green-tower-in-the-sky aesthetic. For example, at first glance, renderings of SOM’s Urban Sequoia project appear to be textbook examples of the Solarpunk aesthetic. However, Yasemin Kologlu, architect and sustainable design leader at SOM, has spent years leading research the research that is represented in the renderings. Leveraging existing technologies and emerging solutions, the utopian visions of Urban Sequoia envision an architecture that employs bio materials (made of cyano-bacteria, hydrogel, sand, warm water), nature-based micro algae systems for carbon sequestration and technologies that can transform their buildings into sources of biofuel. (If you’d like to hear more about the project, check out Yasemin’s Future Fest talk, now available as a free recording.) When backed by research, the Solarpunk aesthetic can be an effective tool for raising money and attracting clients to put the nascent technologies into action.

As the movement currently stands, Solarpunk architecture largely exists online; the majority is utopian eye-candy in the same vein as flying cars and space colonies on Mars. It’s a great way to picture what our future could look like, but it offers virtually nothing in terms of present-day solutions (other than being an escapist reprieve from climate change-induced anxieties — and there is something to be said about that). While we can’t expect Solarpunk buildings to sprout up in most cities anytime soon, we need to change the discussion so that when they do, the towers actually deliver on the promises implied by their aesthetic.";Solarpunk architecture;"- **Definition of Solarpunk Architecture:**  A movement combining **sustainability** and **aesthetic** design, focusing on harmony between people and nature.

The Ones Who Stay and Fight
by N.K. Jemisin

Published in Jan. 2020 (Issue 116) | 3829 words
© 2018 by N. K. Jemisin. Originally published in How Long Til Black Future Month. Reprinted by permission of the author.

It’s the Day of Good Birds in the city of Um-Helat! The Day is a local custom, silly and random as so many local customs can be, and yet beautiful by the same token. It has little to do with birds—a fact about which locals cheerfully laugh, because that, too, is how local customs work. It is a day of fluttering and flight regardless, where pennants of brightly dyed silk plume forth from every window, and delicate drones of copperwire and featherglass—made for this day, and flown on no other!—waft and buzz on the wind. Even the monorail cars trail stylized flamingo feathers from their rooftops, although these are made of featherglass, too, since real flamingos do not fly at the speed of sound.

Um-Helat sits at the confluence of three rivers and an ocean. This places it within the migratory path of several species of butterfly and hummingbird as they travel north to south and back again. At the Day’s dawning, the children of the city come forth, most wearing wings made for them by parents and kind old aunties. (Not all aunties are actually aunties, but in Um-Helat, anyone can earn auntie-hood. This is a city where numberless aspirations can be fulfilled.) Some wings are organza stitched onto school backpacks; some are quilted cotton stuffed with dried flowers and clipped to jacket shoulders. Some few have been carefully glued together from dozens of butterflies’ discarded wings—but only those butterflies that died naturally, of course. Thus adorned, children who can run through the streets do so, leaping off curbs and making whooshing sounds as they pretend to fly. Those who cannot run instead ride special drones, belted and barred and double-checked for safety, which gently bounce them into the air. It’s only a few feet, though it feels like the height of the sky.

But this is no awkward dystopia, where all are forced to conform. Adults who refuse to give up their childhood joys wear wings, too, though theirs tend to be more abstractly constructed. (Some are invisible.) And those who follow faiths which forbid the emulation of beasts, or those who simply do not want wings, need not wear them. They are all honored for this choice, as much as the soarers and flutterers themselves—for without contrasts, how does one appreciate the different forms that joy can take?

Oh, and there is such joy here, friend. Street vendors sell tiny custard-filled cakes shaped like jewel beetles, and people who’ve waited all year wolf them down while sucking air to cool their tongues. Artisans offer cleverly mechanized paper hummingbirds for passersby to throw; the best ones blur as they glide. As the afternoon of the Day grows long, Um-Helat’s farmers arrive, invited as always to be honored alongside the city’s merchants and technologers. By all three groups’ efforts does the city prosper—but when aquifers and rivers dip too low, the farmers move to other lands and farm there, or change from corn-husking to rice-paddying and fishery-feeding. The management of soil and water and chemistry are intricate arts, as you know, but here they have been perfected. Here in Um-Helat there is no hunger: not among the people, and not for the migrating birds and butterflies when they dip down for a taste of savory nectar. And so farmers are particularly celebrated on the Day of Good Birds.

The parade wends through the city, farmers ducking their gazes or laughing as their fellow citizens offer salute. Here is a portly woman, waving a hat of chicken feathers that someone has gifted her. There is a reedy man in a coverall, nervously plucking at the brooch he bears, carved and lacquered to look like a ladybug. He has made it himself, and hopes others will think it fine. They do!

And here! This woman, tall and strong and bare of arm, her sleek brown scalp dotted with implanted silver studs, wearing a fine uniform of stormcloud damask. See how she moves through the crowd, grinning with them, helping up a child who has fallen. She encourages their cheers and their delight, speaking to this person in one language and that person in another. (Um-Helat is a city of polyglots.) She reaches the front of the crowd and immediately spies the reedy man’s ladybug, whereupon with delighted eyes and smile, she makes much of it. She points, and others see it, too, which makes the reedy man blush terribly. But there is only kindness and genuine pleasure in the smiles, and gradually the reedy man stands a little taller, walks with a wider stride. He has made his fellow citizens happier, and there is no finer virtue by the customs of this gentle, rich land.

The slanting afternoon sun stretches golden over the city, reflected light sparkling along its mica-flecked walls and laser-faceted embossings. A breeze blows up from the sea, tasting of brine and minerals, so fresh that a spontaneous cheer wafts along the crowded parade route. Young men by the waterfront, busily stirring great vats of spiced mussels and pans of rice and peas and shrimp, cook faster, for it is said in Um-Helat that the smell of the sea wakes up the belly. Young women on streetcorners bring out sitars and synthesizers and big wooden drums, the better to get the crowd dancing the young men’s way. When people stop, too hot or thirsty to continue, there are glasses of fresh tamarind-lime juice. Elders staff the shops that sell this, though they also give away the juice if a person is much in need. There are always souls needing drumbeats and tamarind, in Um-Helat.

Joyous! It is a steady joy that fills this city, easy to speak of—but ah, though I have tried, it is most difficult to describe accurately. I see the incredulity in your face! The difficulty lies partly in my lack of words, and partly in your lack of understanding, because you have never seen a place like Um-Helat, and because I am myself only an observer, not yet privileged to visit. Thus I must try harder to describe it so that you might embrace it, too.

How can I illuminate the people of Um-Helat? You have seen how they love their children, and how they honor honest, clever labor. You have perhaps noted their many elders, for I have mentioned them in passing. In Um-Helat, people live long and richly, with good health for as long as fate and choice and medicine permits. Every child knows opportunity; every parent has a life. There are some who go without housing, but they can have an apartment if they wish. Here where the spaces under bridges are swept daily and benches have light padding for comfort, they do not live badly. If these itinerant folk dwell also in delusions, they are kept from weapons or places that might do them harm; where they risk disease or injury, they are prevented—or cared for, if matters get out of hand. (We shall speak more of the caretakers soon.)

And so this is Um-Helat: a city whose inhabitants, simply, care for one another. That is a city’s purpose, they believe—not merely to generate revenue or energy or products, but to shelter and nurture the people who do these things.

What have I forgotten to mention? Oh, it is the thing that will seem most fantastic to you, friend: the variety! The citizens of Um-Helat are so many and so wildly different in appearance and origin and development. People in this land come from many others, and it shows in sheen of skin and kink of hair and plumpness of lip and hip. If one wanders the streets where the workers and artisans do their work, there are slightly more people with dark skin; if one strolls the corridors of the executive tower, there are a few extra done in pale. There is history rather than malice in this, and it is still being actively, intentionally corrected—because the people of Um-Helat are not naive believers in good intentions as the solution to all ills. No, there are no worshippers of mere tolerance here, nor desperate grovelers for that grudging pittance of respect which is diversity. Um-Helatians are learned enough to understand what must be done to make the world better, and pragmatic enough to actually enact it.

Does that seem wrong to you? It should not. The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by those concealing ill intent, of insisting that people already suffering should be afflicted with further, unnecessary pain. This is the paradox of tolerance, the treason of free speech: We hesitate to admit that some people are just fucking evil and need to be stopped.

This is Um-Helat, after all, and not that barbaric America. This is not Omelas, a tick of a city, fat and happy with its head buried in a tortured child. My accounting of Um-Helat is an homage, true, but there’s nothing for you to fear, friend.

And so how does Um-Helat exist? How can such a city possibly survive, let alone thrive? Wealthy with no poor, advanced with no war, a beautiful place where all souls know themselves beautiful . . . It cannot be, you say. Utopia? How banal. It’s a fairy tale, a thought exercise. Crabs in a barrel, dog-eat-dog, oppression Olympics—it would not last, you insist. It could never be in the first place. Racism is natural, so natural that we will call it “tribalism” to insinuate that everyone does it. Sexism is natural and homophobia is natural and religious intolerance is natural and greed is natural and cruelty is natural and savagery and fear and and and . . . and. “Impossible!” you hiss, your fists slowly clenching at your sides. “How dare you. What have these people done to make you believe such lies? What are you doing to me, to suggest that it is possible? How dare you. How dare you.”

Oh, friend! I fear I have offended. My apologies.

Yet . . . how else can I convey Um-Helat to you, when even the thought of a happy, just society raises your ire so? Though I confess I am puzzled as to why you are so angry. It’s almost as if you feel threatened by the very idea of equality. Almost as if some part of you needs to be angry. Needs unhappiness and injustice. But . . . do you?

Do you?

Do you believe, friend? Do you accept the Day of Good Birds, the city, the joy? No? Then let me tell you one more thing.

Remember the woman? So tall and brown, so handsome and bald, so loving in her honest pleasure, so fine in her stormcloud gray. She is one of many wearing the same garb, committed to the same purpose. Follow her, now, as she leaves behind the crowd and walks along the biofiber-paved side streets into the shadows. Beneath a skyscraper that floats a few meters off the ground—oh, it is perfectly safe, Um-Helat has controlled gravity for generations now—she stops. There two others await: one gethen, one male, both clad in gray damask, too. They are also bald, their studded heads a-gleam. They greet each other warmly, with hugs where those are welcomed.

They are no one special. Just some of the many people who work to ensure the happiness and prosperity of their fellow citizens. Think of them as social workers if you like; their role is no different from that of social workers anywhere. Word has come of a troubling case, and this is why they gather: to discuss it, and make a difficult decision.

There are wonders far greater than a few floating skyscrapers in Um-Helat, you see, and one of these is the ability to bridge the distances between possibilities—what we would call universes. Anyone can do it, but almost no one tries. That is because, due to a quirk of spacetime, the only world that people in Um-Helat can reach is our own. And why would anyone from this glorious place want to come anywhere near our benighted hellscape?

Again you seem offended. Ah, friend! You have no right to be.

In any case, there’s little danger of travel. Even Um-Helat has not successfully found a way to reduce the tremendous energy demands of macro-scale planar transversal. Only wave particles can move from our world to theirs, and back again. Only information. Who would bother? Ah, but you forget: This is a land where no one hungers, no one is left ill, no one lives in fear, and even war is almost forgotten. In such a place, buoyed by the luxury of safety and comfort, people may seek knowledge solely for knowledge’s sake.

But some knowledge is dangerous.

Um-Helat has been a worse place, after all, in its past. Not all of its peoples, so disparate in origin and custom and language, came together entirely by choice. The city had a different civilization once—one which might not have upset you so! (Poor thing. There, there.) Remnants of that time dot the land all around the city, ruined and enormous and half-broken. Here a bridge. There a great truck, on its back a rusting, curve-sided thing that ancient peoples referred to by the exotic term missile. In the distance: the skeletal remains of another city, once just as vast as Um-Helat, but never so lovely. Works such as these encumber all the land, no more and no less venerable to the Um-Helatians than the rest of the landscape. Indeed, every young citizen must be reminded of these things upon coming of age, and told carefully curated stories of their nature and purpose. When the young citizens learn this, it is a shock almost incomprehensible, in that they literally lack the words to comprehend such things. The languages spoken in Um-Helat were once our languages, yes—for this world was once our world; it was not so much parallel as the same, back then. You might still recognize the languages, but what would puzzle you is how they speak . . . and how they don’t. Oh, some of this will be familiar to you in concept at least, like terms for gender that mean neither he nor she, and the condemnation of words meant to slur and denigrate. And yet you will puzzle over the Um-Helatians’ choice to retain descriptive terms for themselves like kinky-haired or fat or deaf. But these are just words, friend, don’t you see? Without the attached contempt, such terms have no more meaning than if horses could proudly introduce themselves as palomino or miniature or hairy-footed. Difference was never the problem in and of itself—and Um-Helatians still have differences with each other, of opinion and otherwise. Of course they do! They’re people. But what shocks the young citizens of Um-Helat is the realization that, once, those differences of opinion involved differences in respect. That once, value was ascribed to some people, and not others. That once, humanity was acknowledged for some, and not others.

It’s the Day of Good Birds in Um-Helat, where every soul matters, and even the idea that some might not is anathema.

This, then, is why the social workers of Um-Helat have come together: because someone has breached the barrier between worlds. A citizen of Um-Helat has listened, on equipment you would not recognize but which records minute quantum perturbations excited by signal wavelengths, to our radio. He has watched our television. He has followed our social media, played our videos, liked our selfies. We are remarkably primitive, compared to Um-Helat. Time flows the same in both worlds, but people there have not wasted themselves on crushing one another into submission, and this makes a remarkable difference. So anyone can do it—build a thing to traverse the worlds. Like building your own ham radio. Easy. Which is why there is an entire underground industry in Um-Helat—ah! crime! now you believe a little more—built around information gleaned from the strange alien world that is our own. Pamphlets are written and distributed. Art and whispers are traded. The forbidden is so seductive, is it not? Even here, where only things that cause harm to others are called evil. The information-gleaners know that what they do is wrong. They know this is what destroyed the old cities. And indeed, they are horrified at what they hear through the speakers, see on the screens. They begin to perceive that ours is a world where the notion that some people are less important than others has been allowed to take root, and grow until it buckles and cracks the foundations of our humanity. “How could they?” the gleaners exclaim, of us. “Why would they do such things? How can they just leave those people to starve? Why do they not listen when that one complains of disrespect? What does it mean that these ones have been assaulted and no one, no one, cares? Who treats other people like that?” And yet, even amid their marvel, they share the idea. The evil . . . spreads.

So the social workers of Um-Helat stand, talking now, over the body of a man. He is dead—early, unwilling, with a beautifully crafted pike jammed through his spine and heart. (The spine to make it painless. The heart to make it quick.) This is only one of the weapons carried by the social workers, and they prefer it because the pike is silent. Because there was no shot or ricochet, no crackle or sizzle, no scream, no one else will come to investigate. The disease has taken one poor victim, but it need not claim more. In this manner is the contagion contained . . . in a moment. In a moment.

Beside the man’s body crouches a little girl. She’s curly-haired, plump, blind, brown, tall for her age. Normally a boisterous child, she weeps now over her father’s death, and her tears run hot with the injustice of it all. She heard him say, “I’m sorry.” She saw the social workers show the only mercy possible. But she isn’t old enough to have been warned of the consequences of breaking the law, or to understand that her father knew those consequences and accepted them—so to her, what has happened has no purpose or reason. It is a senseless, monstrous, and impossible thing, called murder.

“I’ll get back at you,” she says between sobs. “I’ll make you die the way you made him die.” This is an unthinkable thing to say. Something is very wrong here. She snarls, “How dare you. How dare you.”

The social workers exchange looks of concern. They are contaminated themselves, of course; it’s permitted, and frankly unavoidable in their line of work. Impossible to dam a flood without getting wet. (There are measures in place. The studs on their scalps—well. In our own world, those who volunteered to work in leper colonies were once venerated, and imprisoned with them.) The social workers know, therefore, that for incomprehensible reasons, this girl’s father has shared the poison knowledge of our world with her. An uncontaminated citizen of Um-Helat would have asked “Why?” after the initial shock and horror, because they would expect a reason. There would be a reason. But this girl has already decided that the social workers are less important than her father, and therefore the reason doesn’t matter. She believes that the entire city is less important than one man’s selfishness. Poor child. She is nearly septic with the taint of our world.

Nearly. But then our social worker, the tall brown one who got a hundred strangers to smile at a handmade ladybug, crouches and offers a hand to the child.

What? What surprises you? Did you think this would end with the cold-eyed slaughter of a child? There are other options—and this is Um-Helat, friend, where even a pitiful, diseased child matters. They will keep her in quarantine, and reach out to her for several days. If the girl accepts the hand, listens to them, they will try to explain why her father had to die. She’s early for the knowledge, but something must be done, do you see? Then together they will bury him, with their own hands if they must, in the beautiful garden that they tend between caseloads. This garden holds all the Um-Helatians who broke the law. Just because they have to die as deterrence doesn’t mean they can’t be honored for the sacrifice.

But there is only one treatment for this toxin once it gets into the blood: fighting it. Tooth and nail, spear and claw, up close and brutal; no quarter can be given, no parole, no debate. The child must grow, and learn, and become another social worker fighting an endless war against an idea . . . but she will live, and help others, and find meaning in that. If she takes the woman’s hand.

Does this work for you, at last, friend? Does the possibility of harsh enforcement add enough realism? Are you better able to accept this postcolonial utopia now that you see its bloody teeth? Ah, but they did not choose this battle, the people of Um-Helat today; their ancestors did, when they spun lies and ignored conscience in order to profit from others’ pain. Their greed became a philosophy, a religion, a series of nations, all built on blood. Um-Helat has chosen to be better. But sometimes, only by blood sacrifice may true evil be kept at bay.

And now we come to you, my friend. My little soldier. See what I’ve done? So insidious, these little thoughts, going both ways along the quantum path. Now, perhaps, you will think of Um-Helat, and wish. Now you might finally be able to envision a world where people have learned to love, as they learned in our world to hate. Perhaps you will speak of Um-Helat to others, and spread the notion farther still, like joyous birds migrating on trade winds. It’s possible. Everyone—even the poor, even the lazy, even the undesirable—can matter. Do you see how just the idea of this provokes utter rage in some? That is the infection defending itself . . . because if enough of us believe a thing is possible, then it becomes so.

And then? Who knows. War, maybe. The fire of fever and the purging scourge. No one wants that, but is not the alternative to lie helpless, spotty and blistered and heaving, until we all die?

So don’t walk away. The child needs you, too, don’t you see? You also have to fight for her, now that you know she exists, or walking away is meaningless. Here, here is my hand. Take it. Please.

Good. Good.

Deep in the fissures that plague Koreatown, Christina’s search for her sister reveals something new.

The streets of Koreatown are wounded. Battle scars from the earthquake years gouge Western, Olympic, and Sixth, fissures so wide and deep Christina used to believe the Grand Canyon had grown legs and walked itself across the desert and into their neighborhood. In the worst places, the city’s innards are exposed, rusting pipes and crinkled plastic tubes gaping out between the asphalt like offal. Nobody remembers what this secret urban nervous system was used for anymore — lightrails, solar energy, and MRUs have long since made them obsolete — and nobody in charge of anything important cares enough about 150 blocks of Koreans and Latinos and whomever-else to fund a proper cleanup, so the wounds remain. 

There’s a big, fat fissure right in-between Christina’s apartment building and the Korean BBQ joint where she works weeknights. The crack is just long enough and wide enough to be a pain in the ass, especially after a long shift when she comes home stinking of grill smoke and old sesame oil. The smoke triggers her little sister’s asthma, so the first thing Christina does when she gets home is stand in the doorway and strip down to her underwear, even though it doesn’t make her feel any cleaner and Sadie still needs to fill her inhaler prescription every month. The smell of pollution coats the insides of her nostrils so that even when Christina sleeps, she dreams of burning. 

But she does her little strip-down routine anyway, stepping carefully out of her black slacks and crumpling up her stained apron, because she and Sadie got in a fight over the weekend. 

In a childhood that now feels more far-off than the budding Martian colonies, Christina used to press her nose against the bathroom window and watch a group of daredevils rappel into the chasm on their street, cameras protruding from their helmets like antennae. She would fantasize about strapping into the overcomplicated, brightly-colored polyester harnesses once her limbs stretched out to their full length and her mother stopped worrying so goddamn much. 

When Umma died, Christina learned one of the colder facts of life: Someone must always be around to worry. Like a parasite, her mother’s worry latched onto her, and when Christina found Sadie’s breath frosting the same window as she watched some university-looking people disappear into the crack with scanners and spades, she grabbed her by the wrist and dragged her away. 

Christina pauses in just her tank top, the day’s tips crumpled in her left hand. Their building, like most in the city, overflows with bodies. Human bodies, droid bodies, cat bodies, crusty white dog bodies. They add their voices to the systematic hum of the building’s Moisture Recycling Units and the back-of-your-throat buzz of the solar panels scaling the roof and walls like armor. The walls are so thin that normally, Christina can hear Sadie all the way from the elevator: the rhythm of her fingers against her school-issued TouchBook and the grating sound of old cartoons, which she’ll switch off and lie about when she hears Christina’s keys in the door. It’s like a song she knows by heart, a frequency her entire body is attuned to.

Today, however, there is only silence.

Christina pauses in the hallway, straining her ears, but the only sound that fills them is that of her own rushing blood. 

She chucks aside her smoke-stained clothes, pulls on some acceptably clean pants, and heads for Sadie’s room. She must be in there. She has to be. Argument or no, Sadie isn’t the sort to just run off.

And indeed, someone is sitting in Sadie’s desk chair, the same old sticker-battered TouchBook resting in their lap. But this someone isn’t her sister. 

Christina lets out a sharp shout and grabs the first blunt object she finds, which turns out to be a Pokémon plush doll. It bounces harmlessly off the strange man’s head.

“No — please, wait!” He jumps to his feet, hands raised. He’s certainly an adult, despite the squeaky tenor of his voice, and the realization that a strange adult man is in her 12-year-old sister’s room fills Christina with a rage she’s never known. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t realize anyone would be home —”

“Where is she?” Christina grabs an umbrella next, wielding it threateningly. 

“I don’t know. We had arranged a meeting — I’m her science teacher, Mr. Park-Llewelyn? Dafydd? We met, very briefly, at parent-teacher night.” 

“Her science teacher,” Christina repeats dryly. She doesn’t lower the umbrella, although the man’s face does look vaguely familiar. 

“Yes — well, climate solutions teacher, to be exact.” He swallows and adjusts his glasses, and somewhere in that motion, Christina sees a glimmer of truth. “Sadie didn’t mention our meeting?”

It’s a question. All of him, in fact, seems to be something of a question. He’s younger than she would have expected for a teacher, but he dresses like a character out of a 20th-century film. Old-fashioned-style brogues, spectacles, even a goddamn sweater vest. Under her glare, Mr. Park-Llewelyn turns a faint shade of pink.

“What are you doing here?” she demands, crossing her arms.

“Sadie’s missed school today, which I’m sure you know isn’t like her at all.” He blinks at her from behind his gold-rimmed glasses. “We had a meeting set up to discuss her inclusion in the Green Students Alliance —”

“What the hell is that?”

“Oh — she didn’t tell you?” Christina’s eyes narrow, and Dafydd’s cheeks deepen from pink to crimson. “I’m sorry, I just assumed — it’s a student-run organization at the high school that I supervise. They take on various community projects, like street cleanups, community gardens, and even writing up proposals and presenting them to the city. Sadie got really excited about the group, so we were talking about a way to … Are you alright, Ms. Cho?”

Christina dabs the corner of her eye and is horrified to find it wet. 

Ever since Umma, she and Sadie have lived their whole lives in a bubble. There wasn’t a thing Christina didn’t know about her younger sister, and vice versa. But now she’s out living an alien life, one where some bespectacled geek Christina has never seen before speaks about her with admiration and familiarity, and it stings. 

“Yeah. Grill smoke.”

Dafydd’s eyes soften around the corners. “I found the door unlocked, with no sign of her. I just want to make sure she’s alright.”

Christina nods, short and sharp. “Me too.”


It is a point of pride that Christina has never utilized Sadie’s wrist com tracker. Trust has always been paramount, and Christina still remembers the time her left arm lit up like a Christmas tree just as Matty Romero leaned forward to kiss her. That sort of humiliation is hard to forget.

“At least she’s in the building,” Dafydd offers. They’re taking the emergency stairwell to the roof, two steps at a time, and sweat slicks Christina’s hairline. (The tracker, alas, has no sense of height.) 

Christina glances down at her portable TouchBook and curses. Sadie’s location has already shifted since she last checked, and it keeps fading in and out and reappearing in random locations, as if something is interrupting the signal.

“Let’s just rule the roof out and keep going,” she grumbles. 

Sometimes Christina’s world goes blurry around the edges. Her physician says she needs glasses, but you don’t need glasses to work at a barbecue place. What is there to look at in this world of theirs, anyway? The sky over the city is permanently gray, and so are the streets, and the buildings. Even the people around her seem to be bleeding away color day after day. Because of this, Christina has never gone up to the roof before. She knows what kind of view awaits her. 

So when she and Dafydd unstick the door to the roof, the blur of green comes as something of a surprise. 

The rooftop is opulent with plant life. It is more green than Christina has seen in her 25 years of life combined, more green than she thought was left in the world. A rarefied, spectacular green, not the pasty hue of the genetically engineered Vegetable Supplement or the hungry neon of the algae gnawing at the surface of the L.A. river, but all of those hues combined along with several hundred more. Not even the highest quality sims at the local VR-bangs feature colors like these. 

“Remarkable!” Dafydd exclaims, and Christina shoots him an incredulous sideways glance. “Of all the green roofs I’ve seen, this has to be the most abundant.”

“I didn’t think we had the money,” she says softly, stepping into the softly waving strands of grass. It blankets most of the roof, leaving space only for a tangle of narrow paths that lead to a terrace full of hanging pots and several raised garden beds. A few elderly residents in shiny plastic visors and pink dishwashing gloves roam amongst the plants, chattering intermittently in a mix of Korean, Spanish, and English. Christina pauses to run her thumb down the fleshy white spine of a head of Napa cabbage. The same raised bed hosts a bristling bush of fragrant, heart-shaped leaves, each one as wide as her hand. 

“Perilla,” Dafydd says, just as Christina recalls the proper word and says, “깻잎.” They exchange a startled glance. To her surprise, he smiles.

Mrs. Im from the third floor comes up to them. Her wrinkled face is sun-browned and sweet, like a date. She says something in quick Korean, and Dafydd and Christina both shake their heads apologetically.

“Sadie,” Mrs. Im rasps. Her calloused hands clutch Christina’s. 

“I think she’s been coming up here to help,” Dafydd says, and Christina could smack herself. How could she not see Sadie’s touch at work in this place, from the bubbly handwriting labeling each plant to the lupines — her favorite — growing in vibrant purple spikes alongside the hot pepper plants? She lets Mrs. Im drag her along, through the jeweled garden and past the veil, to the roof’s edge. 

“There,” Mrs. Im says, pointing at the fissured road 10 floors below. “Down.”

“Oh, God.” Christina clutches the edge of the roof, the grit indenting her palms. “Dafydd, she’s in the ground.”


Back when people first started venturing into the fissures, the city put barbed wire and LAPD around them. This only lasted a month or so, and as the other cracks throughout the city got filled in one by one, Koreatown was eventually forgotten.

Only teenagers in search of a smoke spot and idealistic fools looking for a way to heal the neighborhood venture down there now. Some of them have accomplished small miracles, like the team of undergrads that managed to plug a major natural gas leak a few years ago and the single mother who campaigned until she got part of the Olympic crack filled in after her 2-year-old fell in. But for the most part, the fissures are something to be avoided and ignored. The rest of the world may be reforesting and sucking carbon out of the air and cleaning the oceans and lakes, but what are people like Christina, who can barely afford the monthly subsidy on their Moisture Recycling Unit, supposed to do? 

Christina and Dafydd stand at the edge of the crevice. Her emergency flashlight casts a sickly beam of light into the abyss, illuminating jagged pipe ends and fraying cables.

Her wrist com chirps softly. Elevated heart rate. Recommended to remove stressors from your environment and practice circular breathing for the next two minutes.

Christina grits her teeth. They have no harnesses, no carabiners, not even a bicycle helmet to protect their skulls. But Sadie’s signal is on the move, and there is nowhere to go but down.

She takes the first step. A small cascade of pebbles rains down, into the dark.

Elevated and irregular respiratory rate.

Elevated blood pressure. 

There’s a small ledge a yard down. She drops onto it, the impact reverberating through her knees. She still can’t see the bottom.

“Come down,” she shouts.

“Are you sure?” Dafydd’s voice trembles around the edges. “Shouldn’t we just call someone?”

“I’m not getting her in trouble.” She reaches out and grasps a dead cable, yanking on it to test its hold. She has no idea if it will be long enough or secure enough to get her to the bottom without killing her, but there is only one way to find out.

She wraps it around her waist as Dafydd scrambles down, the light glinting off his glasses. 

“Don’t tell me we’re going to jump,” he groans once he sees her makeshift harness.

“I’m going to jump. You do whatever you want.” She wraps the cable around her knuckles twice. 

“I can’t let you go down there alone.”

“Well, then, come on.” She holds out her hand.

After some hesitation, he takes it.


This deep inside the earth, the sky becomes like more than a distant memory. Night deepens as Christina and Dafydd travel further down the chasm. Christina’s wrist com won’t stop nagging her, so she shuts it off. When was the last time she did that? Let herself sink into silence and emptiness?

“Are you from around here?” she asks, when the quiet becomes too terrible to bear.

She feels, rather than sees, when he shakes his head.

“Cardiff, then Detroit. But my mom’s side is from here. Her family first came here in the 20th century.” 

One hundred years of Koreatown ancestry. For many, this neighborhood is more of a motherland than Unified Korea ever will be, but why doesn’t it feel that way? 

“It’s funny,” he carries on as they forge ahead, and even though she didn’t ask, she listens. “Even with my fissures, my mom says this place hasn’t changed a bit, and probably never will.”

“You don’t believe that.” Christina says flatly.

“No.” His voice drops to almost a whisper. “Not for a moment. Not while there are kids like Sadie and the Greenies.”

Unexpectedly, she snorts. “Oh, God. Please tell me you don’t call them that.”

“Hey, it wasn’t my idea.” He stops, so abruptly that Christina walks right into him. “Do you hear that?”

The flashlight’s beam wiggles up and down the layers of broken earth. Christina listens carefully, her hands still pressed against the planes of Dafydd’s back.

“Rain?”

“Better,” Dafydd says, starting forward again.

They follow the distant sound of rainfall to a widening in the fissure, almost a cavern. The first few drops land on Christina’s cheeks, and when she cranes her neck back and Dafydd shines his wavering spotlight toward the sky, the light glints off a familiar, heart-shaped reflection: Sadie’s glasses.

Sadie stands on a broad shelf of earth several yards above them, a green hose dangling from her hand. The drops turn into a fine mist that wets Christina’s face, kissing her cheeks and forming beads of dew on her lashes and lips. Sadie isn’t alone. A dozen teenagers stand on various outcroppings along the crevice’s walls. Most are accompanied by portable Moisture Recycling Units, bullet-shaped silver contraptions each the size of a Pekingese. 

The earth beneath Christina’s feet — earth, not cement or gravel or asphalt—is rich and dense with moisture. Every foot or so, a new sprout protrudes from the dirt.

“You,” Christina calls out to her sister, already laughing from a mixture of relief and pure, exuberant joy, “are in so much trouble!”

“Don’t step on my tomatoes,” Sadie calls back. “Mr. Park-Llewelyn, is that you?”

One of the teenagers groans. “It was supposed to be a surprise!”

“They must have put this together without my knowing,” Dafydd murmurs, a dimple appearing in each cheek. “Some sort of … community garden? And a native plant nursery!” He kneels, cupping a small bundle of silvery leaves between his hands. “This is white sage, a California native that’s been threatened in the wild for almost a century. They must have grown it from seed — Oh!” He jumps back, startled, as a white-winged moth zips past his nose.

Christina laughs and reaches for his arm.

“Come on,” she says, eyes fixed on her sister, the lone star in the hazy night sky. “Let’s go.”";Lynn D. Jung | “We Cast Our Eyes to the Unknowable Now” (2025);"-**Title:**  ""We Cast Our Eyes to the Unknowable Now""

Post 1 - 2024 Aesthetic Explorations
2 Comments
Atompunk is a futuristic aesthetic focused on how the world would have evolved from the nuclear age of the 1950’s and 60’s. In this timeline the transistor is never invented. This is therefore a future without the digital age. Instead of computers growing smaller and smaller, technology is larger and clunky. Every screen uses cathode ray technology rather than the LED screens we have become accustomed to. It is a representation of the future envisioned during the 1950s in the US.

This aesthetic was introduced during the 1950’s and 1960’s in cold war America. This was a world scared of communism and in love with space and the nuclear age. Born in the wake of World War II, there was a strong national pride focused on the advancement of technology. The atom bomb had been dropped on Japan, ending the war. Therefore, the US public became obsessed with the unique power their country wielded. In the image below we can see a 1950’s sunglass advertisement in conjunction with a nuclear test. This image helps give context to the obsession’s the American public had with nukes and nuclear energy. They saw this as the way we would power the new world. During the 50’s there was even a tourism aspect to nuclear tests. You could buy a ticket to witness the explosion of a nuke outside the city limits of Las Vegas.

The atompunk aesthetic takes the obsession of nuclear power and combines it with the futuristic aspects of the space race. The Jetsons TV show is one of the first shows to popularize the aesthetic. The show focuses on the stereotypical nuclear family living in space.

The Superman comics from the 50’s also begin to introduce audiences to this style of art and design. The comic cover below shows a red space ship that is in the very distinct style of atompunk. It is very pointy and small relative to our modern day rockets. In this fictional universe the beauty of the world is prioritized more than the functionality. The title features the word “atomic age” while the background depicts outer space. This is a clear example of how people in the 50’s viewed the future. They imagine a world where we fight in space while living in the atomic age.

In the past 10 to 15 years there has been an Atompunk revival. Numerous video games like the Fallout series or Call of Duty have incorporated this style into their world design. Below is an Instagram post from Bethesda Game Studios for a Fallout game that came out a few years ago. The woman is being tended to my a futuristic robot while she prepares for her big show. In the background there is a cartoon of a nuke while she drinking a cola called “Nuka Cola”.

The Call of Duty game Black Ops II even features an entire map called Nuketown 2025. The city is decorated in the Atompunk style. There are signs and cars that are all clearly inspired by the 1950’s but have a futuristic touch to them. The city only exists for nuclear weapons testing. At the end of the game a nuke goes off wiping out the entire city in the process.

Another example of atompunk in our modern world is from the cartoon show Dexter’s Lab. The background below shows a small suburban house surrounded by a hyper futuristic city. The city sky line is dotted with rockets and nuclear power plants. Everything is very pointy and tall like the art work from “The Jetsons” and the “Superman” comic above. There is even a building in the middle that starkly resembles the Seattle Space Needle. The Space Needle was built in 1962 to resemble a flying saucer from a UFO. It clearly is another example atompunk.

**Tuyên bố kiến ​​nghị:**  
Ngôi nhà này tin rằng những tòa nhà cũ được xây dựng lại là những sáng tạo hoàn toàn mới, không phải là sự tiếp nối của quá khứ.

**Định nghĩa & Phạm vi:**  
- **Tòa nhà cũ được xây dựng lại:** Các công trình kiến ​​trúc đã bị thay đổi, cải tạo hoặc xây dựng lại đáng kể, thường sử dụng một số vật liệu hoặc thiết kế ban đầu.
- **Sáng tạo hoàn toàn mới:** Các tòa nhà được coi là hoàn toàn khác biệt với hình thức trước đây và không có tính liên tục về mặt lịch sử.
- **Tiếp nối quá khứ:** Các tòa nhà vẫn giữ được ý nghĩa và bản sắc lịch sử dù đã được cải tạo hoặc xây dựng lại.
- **Phạm vi:** Cuộc tranh luận này có thể tập trung vào nhiều loại công trình khác nhau (dân cư, thương mại, lịch sử) và có thể được xem xét trong các bối cảnh địa lý khác nhau (thành thị và nông thôn) và các khoảng thời gian (hiện đại và lịch sử).

**Bối cảnh & Bối cảnh:**  
Cuộc tranh luận về việc liệu các tòa nhà cũ được xây dựng lại là những sáng tạo mới hay sự tiếp nối của quá khứ có ý nghĩa quan trọng trong kiến ​​trúc, quy hoạch đô thị và di sản văn hóa. Khi các thành phố phát triển, nhiều tòa nhà cũ bị phá bỏ hoặc cải tạo rộng rãi. Điều này đặt ra câu hỏi về bản sắc, sự bảo tồn và giá trị của kiến ​​trúc lịch sử. Cuộc thảo luận có liên quan đến bối cảnh phát triển đô thị, tính bền vững và ký ức văn hóa.

**Đề xuất/Bên khẳng định (Ủng hộ Kiến nghị):**  
**Lập trường cốt lõi:** Bên này lập luận rằng các tòa nhà cũ được xây dựng lại, do được cải tạo hoặc xây dựng lại trên diện rộng, nên được xem như những thực thể hoàn toàn mới chứ không phải là phần mở rộng của những tòa nhà tiền nhiệm lịch sử của chúng.

**Lý lẽ/Chủ đề tiềm năng:**  
1. **Biến đổi bản sắc:** Các cấu trúc được xây dựng lại thường thay đổi nhiều đến mức mất đi bản sắc ban đầu.
2. **Chức năng hiện đại:** Các thiết kế và công nghệ mới có thể khiến các tòa nhà cũ không thể nhận ra và phù hợp hơn với nhu cầu hiện đại.
3. **Tiến hóa văn hóa:** Các giá trị và thẩm mỹ của xã hội phát triển, khiến các công trình kiến ​​trúc được xây dựng lại phản ánh bối cảnh văn hóa hiện tại hơn là bối cảnh lịch sử.
4. **Thay đổi về pháp lý và quyền sở hữu:** Khung pháp lý và quyền sở hữu mới có thể xác định lại trạng thái của tòa nhà như một công trình kiến ​​tạo mới.
5. **Đổi mới trong thiết kế:** Quá trình sáng tạo liên quan đến việc xây dựng lại có thể dẫn đến những cách thể hiện kiến ​​trúc độc đáo khác với nguyên bản.

;;;;;;debate;;;This house believes using old, dead brand names for new products is misleading.;"**Motion Statement:**  
This house believes using old, dead brand names for new products is misleading.

**Definitions & Scope:**  
- **Old, dead brand names:** Brands that were once popular or well-known but are no longer in use or have ceased operations.
- **New products:** Items that are recently developed or introduced to the market.
- **Misleading:** Causing someone to have a wrong idea or impression about something.
- **Scope:** This debate will focus on the use of old brand names in marketing and product development, primarily in consumer goods, without geographical limitations.

**Context & Background:**  
The practice of reviving old brand names for new products has been a marketing strategy for decades. Companies often believe that using a familiar name can evoke nostalgia and attract consumers. However, this can lead to confusion about the product's quality and origin, especially if the original brand had a different reputation or was associated with a different product category.

**Proposition/Affirmative Side (Supporting the Motion):**  
**Core Stance:**  
This side argues that using old, dead brand names for new products is misleading because it can create false expectations and confuse consumers about the product's quality and authenticity.

**Potential Arguments/Themes:**  
1. **Consumer Confusion:** Reviving old brands can mislead consumers who associate the name with past products that may have been of higher quality.
2. **False Advertising:** Using a brand name that no longer represents the current product can be seen as deceptive marketing.
3. **Loss of Brand Integrity:** Old brands may have a legacy that new products do not uphold, leading to a dilution of brand value.
4. **Nostalgia vs. Reality:** While nostalgia can attract customers, it can also lead to disappointment if the new product does not meet expectations set by the old brand.
5. **Ethical Considerations:** Companies have a responsibility to be transparent about the origins and quality of their products.

**Potential Evidence Types:**  
- Consumer surveys showing confusion or disappointment with revived brands.
- Case studies of failed products that used old brand names.
- Expert opinions from marketing professionals on brand integrity.
- Historical examples of brand revivals and their outcomes.

**Opposition/Negative Side (Opposing the Motion):**  
**Core Stance:**  
This side argues that using old, dead brand names for new products is not misleading and can be a legitimate marketing strategy that benefits both consumers and companies.

**Potential Arguments/Themes:**  
1. **Brand Recognition:** Old brand names can leverage existing recognition, making it easier for consumers to trust new products.
2. **Nostalgia Marketing:** Evoking nostalgia can create emotional connections that enhance consumer loyalty and interest.
3. **Innovation and Reinvention:** Reviving a brand can signify innovation and a new direction, rather than misleading consumers.
4. **Consumer Choice:** Consumers are responsible for researching products; using an old brand name is just one of many marketing strategies.
5. **Market Demand:** If there is a demand for products under old brand names, it reflects consumer interest rather than deception.

**Potential Evidence Types:**  
- Marketing studies showing the effectiveness of nostalgia in advertising.
- Examples of successful product launches using old brand names.
- Consumer testimonials expressing positive experiences with revived brands.
- Data on sales performance of products using old brand names.

**Key Areas of Clash:**  
- The impact of consumer perception and trust in brand names.
- The ethical implications of marketing practices.
- The balance between nostalgia and authenticity in branding.
- The responsibility of companies in informing consumers about product origins.

**Important Considerations/Nuances:**  
- The distinction between genuine brand revivals and mere exploitation of nostalgia.

---------------
**Tuyên bố kiến ​​nghị:**  
Ngôi nhà này tin rằng việc sử dụng những thương hiệu cũ, đã chết cho các sản phẩm mới là sai lầm.

**Định nghĩa & Phạm vi:**  
- **Thương hiệu cũ, chết:** Thương hiệu đã từng phổ biến hoặc được nhiều người biết đến nhưng không còn sử dụng hoặc đã ngừng hoạt động.
- **Sản phẩm mới:** Các mặt hàng mới được phát triển hoặc giới thiệu ra thị trường gần đây.
- **Gây hiểu lầm:** Khiến ai đó có ý tưởng hoặc ấn tượng sai lầm về điều gì đó.
- **Phạm vi:** Cuộc tranh luận này sẽ tập trung vào việc sử dụng các thương hiệu cũ trong tiếp thị và phát triển sản phẩm, chủ yếu là hàng tiêu dùng, không có giới hạn về mặt địa lý.

**Bối cảnh & Bối cảnh:**  
Việc phục hồi các thương hiệu cũ cho các sản phẩm mới đã là một chiến lược tiếp thị trong nhiều thập kỷ. Các công ty thường tin rằng việc sử dụng một cái tên quen thuộc có thể gợi lên nỗi nhớ và thu hút người tiêu dùng. Tuy nhiên, điều này có thể dẫn đến nhầm lẫn về chất lượng và nguồn gốc của sản phẩm, đặc biệt nếu thương hiệu ban đầu có danh tiếng khác hoặc gắn liền với một chủng loại sản phẩm khác.

**Đề xuất/Bên khẳng định (Ủng hộ Kiến nghị):**  
**Quan điểm cốt lõi:**  
Phía này cho rằng việc sử dụng tên thương hiệu cũ, đã chết cho sản phẩm mới là sai lệch vì có thể tạo ra những kỳ vọng sai lầm, khiến người tiêu dùng nhầm lẫn về chất lượng cũng như tính xác thực của sản phẩm.

**Lý lẽ/Chủ đề tiềm năng:**  
1. **Sự nhầm lẫn của người tiêu dùng:** Việc hồi sinh các thương hiệu cũ có thể đánh lừa người tiêu dùng khi liên kết tên tuổi với các sản phẩm trước đây có thể có chất lượng cao hơn.
2. **Quảng cáo sai sự thật:** Sử dụng tên thương hiệu không còn đại diện cho sản phẩm hiện tại có thể bị coi là hành vi tiếp thị lừa đảo.
3. **Mất tính toàn vẹn của thương hiệu:** Các thương hiệu cũ có thể có một di sản mà các sản phẩm mới không phát huy được, dẫn đến sự suy giảm giá trị thương hiệu.
4. **Nỗi nhớ so với hiện thực:** Mặc dù sự hoài niệm có thể thu hút khách hàng nhưng nó cũng có thể dẫn đến sự thất vọng nếu sản phẩm mới không đáp ứng được kỳ vọng mà thương hiệu cũ đặt ra.
5. **Cân nhắc về mặt đạo đức:** Các công ty có trách nhiệm minh bạch về nguồn gốc và chất lượng sản phẩm của mình.

**Các loại bằng chứng tiềm năng:**  
- Khảo sát người tiêu dùng cho thấy sự nhầm lẫn hoặc thất vọng với các thương hiệu được hồi sinh.
- Nghiên cứu trường hợp sản phẩm thất bại sử dụng thương hiệu cũ.
- Ý kiến ​​chuyên gia từ các chuyên gia tiếp thị về tính toàn vẹn của thương hiệu.
- Những ví dụ lịch sử về sự hồi sinh thương hiệu và kết quả của chúng.

**Phản đối/Phía tiêu cực (Phản đối kiến ​​nghị):**  
**Quan điểm cốt lõi:**  
Bên này cho rằng việc sử dụng những thương hiệu cũ, đã chết cho sản phẩm mới không phải là sai lầm và có thể là một chiến lược tiếp thị hợp pháp mang lại lợi ích cho cả người tiêu dùng và doanh nghiệp.

**Lý lẽ/Chủ đề tiềm năng:**  
1. **Nhận diện thương hiệu:** Tên thương hiệu cũ có thể tận dụng sự nhận biết hiện có, giúp người tiêu dùng dễ tin tưởng vào sản phẩm mới hơn.
2. **Tiếp thị nỗi nhớ:** Khơi dậy nỗi nhớ có thể tạo ra những kết nối cảm xúc giúp nâng cao lòng trung thành và sự quan tâm của người tiêu dùng.
3. **Đổi mới và tái tạo:** Phục hồi một thương hiệu có thể biểu thị sự đổi mới và hướng đi mới, thay vì gây hiểu lầm cho người tiêu dùng.
4. **Lựa chọn của người tiêu dùng:** Người tiêu dùng chịu trách nhiệm nghiên cứu sản phẩm; sử dụng tên thương hiệu cũ chỉ là một trong nhiều chiến lược tiếp thị.
5. **Nhu cầu thị trường:** Nếu có nhu cầu về sản phẩm mang nhãn hiệu cũ, điều đó phản ánh sự quan tâm của người tiêu dùng chứ không phải lừa dối.

**Các loại bằng chứng tiềm năng:**  
- Các nghiên cứu tiếp thị cho thấy hiệu quả của sự hoài niệm trong quảng cáo.
- Ví dụ về việc ra mắt sản phẩm thành công bằng cách sử dụng tên thương hiệu cũ.
- Lời chứng thực của người tiêu dùng thể hiện trải nghiệm tích cực với các thương hiệu được hồi sinh.
- Số liệu về kết quả kinh doanh các sản phẩm sử dụng nhãn hiệu cũ.

**Các lĩnh vực xung đột chính:**  
- Tác động đến nhận thức và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng đối với thương hiệu.
- Ý nghĩa đạo đức của hoạt động tiếp thị.
- Sự cân bằng giữa hoài cổ và chân thực trong xây dựng thương hiệu.
- Trách nhiệm của doanh nghiệp trong việc thông tin cho người tiêu dùng về nguồn gốc sản phẩm.

**Cân nhắc/Sắc thái quan trọng:**  
- Sự khác biệt giữa việc hồi sinh thương hiệu đích thực và việc khai thác nỗi nhớ đơn thuần.
- Vai trò của giáo dục người tiêu dùng trong việc tìm hiểu lịch sử thương hiệu.
- Những tác động pháp lý tiềm ẩn liên quan đến nhãn hiệu và việc sử dụng thương hiệu.
- Ảnh hưởng của bối cảnh văn hóa đến phản ứng của người tiêu dùng đối với thương hiệu hồi sinh.

This house believes social media companies should be blamed for the bad things their computer programs (algorithms) promote.

**Definitions & Scope:**  
- **Social Media Companies:** Businesses that provide platforms for users to create and share content or participate in social networking (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).
- **Algorithms:** Computer programs that analyze data and make decisions based on that data, often used to determine what content users see.
- **Bad Things:** Negative outcomes or harmful content promoted by algorithms, such as misinformation, hate speech, or harmful behaviors.
- **Scope:** The debate will focus on social media platforms primarily in the context of the last decade, considering global implications but with a focus on Western countries.

**Context & Background:**  
Social media has become a dominant form of communication and information sharing in the 21st century. Algorithms play a crucial role in determining what content users see, often prioritizing engagement over accuracy or safety. This has led to concerns about the spread of misinformation, cyberbullying, and the promotion of harmful content. The debate over the responsibility of social media companies has gained traction as incidents of online harm have increased.

**Proposition/Affirmative Side (Supporting the Motion):**  
- **Core Stance:** This side argues that social media companies are responsible for the negative impacts of their algorithms because they design and control these systems.

- **Potential Arguments/Themes:**
  1. Algorithms prioritize engagement, leading to the spread of sensational or harmful content.

- **Potential Arguments/Themes:**
  1. Users have agency and responsibility for their choices online.
  2. Algorithms are tools that can be used for both good and bad; the focus should be on user behavior.
  3. Blaming companies could stifle innovation and improvements in technology.
  4. Other factors, such as societal issues and individual mental health, contribute to online harm.
  5. Regulation and education are more effective solutions than blaming companies.

- **Potential Evidence Types:**
  - Research on user behavior and decision-making online.

;;;;;;debate;;;This house believes people don't really have free will to make their own choices.;"**Motion Statement:**  
This house believes people don't really have free will to make their own choices.

**Definitions & Scope:**  
- **Free Will:** The ability to make choices that are not determined by prior causes or external factors.
- **Choices:** Decisions made by individuals that can affect their lives and circumstances.
- **Scope:** This debate will focus on philosophical, psychological, and sociological perspectives, primarily within a contemporary context.

**Context & Background:**  
The concept of free will has been debated for centuries, with philosophers like Aristotle, Kant, and more recently, neuroscientists exploring whether humans truly have the ability to choose freely. The rise of determinism, which suggests that all events, including human actions, are determined by preceding events, has sparked discussions about the nature of choice and responsibility.

**Proposition/Affirmative Side (Supporting the Motion):**  
**Core Stance:** This side argues that free will is an illusion and that our choices are influenced by various factors beyond our control.

**Potential Arguments/Themes:**  
1. **Determinism:** All actions are determined by genetics, environment, and past experiences.
2. **Neuroscience:** Studies show that brain activity predicting decisions occurs before individuals are consciously aware of making those decisions.
3. **Social Conditioning:** Cultural and societal influences shape our preferences and choices, limiting true freedom.
4. **Psychological Factors:** Cognitive biases and emotional states can heavily influence decision-making.
5. **Economic and Social Constraints:** Access to resources and opportunities can restrict the choices available to individuals.

**Potential Evidence Types:**  
- Neuroscience studies on decision-making.
- Psychological research on cognitive biases.
- Historical examples of social conditioning.
- Statistics on socioeconomic factors affecting choices.
- Expert opinions from philosophers and scientists.

**Opposition/Negative Side (Opposing the Motion):**  
**Core Stance:** This side argues that individuals do have free will and can make choices independent of external influences.

**Potential Arguments/Themes:**  
1. **Moral Responsibility:** If free will is an illusion, it undermines the concept of accountability for actions.
2. **Personal Agency:** Individuals can reflect, deliberate, and make choices that are not solely determined by external factors.
3. **Existentialism:** Philosophical perspectives that emphasize individual freedom and the ability to create one's own essence through choices.
4. **Variability of Choices:** People often make choices that contradict their conditioning or past experiences.
5. **Empirical Evidence of Choice:** Instances where individuals overcome significant obstacles to make different choices.

**Potential Evidence Types:**  
- Case studies of individuals who changed their life paths.
- Philosophical texts supporting free will.
- Psychological studies on decision-making autonomy.
- Examples of social movements driven by individual choices.
- Testimonials from people who have made significant life changes.

**Key Areas of Clash:**  
- The nature of determinism vs. free will.
- The role of external influences versus personal agency.
- The implications of free will on moral responsibility.
- The impact of neuroscience on our understanding of choice.

**Important Considerations/Nuances:**  
- The debate may involve discussions on compatibilism, which suggests that free will and determinism can coexist.
- Consideration of mental health issues that may affect decision-making.
- The influence of technology and social media on choices in modern society.";;;;"Ngôi nhà này tin rằng mọi người không thực sự có ý chí tự do để đưa ra lựa chọn của riêng mình.

**Tuyên bố kiến ​​nghị:**  
Ngôi nhà này tin rằng mọi người không thực sự có ý chí tự do để đưa ra lựa chọn của riêng mình.

**Định nghĩa & Phạm vi:**  
- **Ý chí tự do:** Khả năng đưa ra những lựa chọn không được xác định bởi những nguyên nhân trước đó hoặc các yếu tố bên ngoài.
- **Lựa chọn:** Những quyết định do cá nhân đưa ra có thể ảnh hưởng đến cuộc sống và hoàn cảnh của họ.
- **Phạm vi:** Cuộc tranh luận này sẽ tập trung vào các quan điểm triết học, tâm lý và xã hội học, chủ yếu trong bối cảnh đương đại.

**Bối cảnh & Bối cảnh:**  
Khái niệm ý chí tự do đã được tranh luận trong nhiều thế kỷ, với các triết gia như Aristotle, Kant và gần đây hơn là các nhà khoa học thần kinh khám phá liệu con người có thực sự có khả năng tự do lựa chọn hay không. Sự trỗi dậy của thuyết tiền định, cho rằng tất cả các sự kiện, bao gồm cả hành động của con người, đều được xác định bởi các sự kiện trước đó, đã làm dấy lên các cuộc thảo luận về bản chất của sự lựa chọn và trách nhiệm.

**Đề xuất/Bên khẳng định (Ủng hộ Kiến nghị):**  
**Lập trường cốt lõi:** Bên này lập luận rằng ý chí tự do là ảo tưởng và các lựa chọn của chúng ta bị ảnh hưởng bởi nhiều yếu tố khác nhau nằm ngoài tầm kiểm soát của chúng ta.

**Lý lẽ/Chủ đề tiềm năng:**  
1. **Tính quyết định:** Mọi hành động đều được quyết định bởi di truyền, môi trường và kinh nghiệm trong quá khứ.
2. **Khoa học thần kinh:** Các nghiên cứu cho thấy các quyết định dự đoán hoạt động của não xảy ra trước khi các cá nhân nhận thức được việc đưa ra các quyết định đó một cách có ý thức.
3. **Điều kiện xã hội:** Những ảnh hưởng về văn hóa và xã hội định hình sở thích và lựa chọn của chúng ta, hạn chế quyền tự do thực sự.
4. **Yếu tố tâm lý:** Những thành kiến ​​về nhận thức và trạng thái cảm xúc có thể ảnh hưởng nặng nề đến việc ra quyết định.
5. **Ràng buộc về kinh tế và xã hội:** Việc tiếp cận các nguồn lực và cơ hội có thể hạn chế các lựa chọn dành cho cá nhân.

**Các loại bằng chứng tiềm năng:**  
- Nghiên cứu khoa học thần kinh về việc ra quyết định.
- Nghiên cứu tâm lý về khuynh hướng nhận thức.
- Ví dụ lịch sử về điều kiện xã hội.
- Thống kê các yếu tố kinh tế xã hội ảnh hưởng đến sự lựa chọn.
- Ý kiến ​​chuyên gia từ các triết gia và nhà khoa học.

**Phản đối/Phía tiêu cực (Phản đối kiến ​​nghị):**  
**Lập trường cốt lõi:** Bên này lập luận rằng các cá nhân có quyền tự do ý chí và có thể đưa ra lựa chọn độc lập với những tác động bên ngoài.

**Lý lẽ/Chủ đề tiềm năng:**  
1. **Trách nhiệm đạo đức:** Nếu ý chí tự do là một ảo tưởng, nó sẽ làm suy yếu khái niệm về trách nhiệm giải trình đối với các hành động.
2. **Tác động cá nhân:** Các cá nhân có thể suy ngẫm, cân nhắc và đưa ra những lựa chọn không chỉ được xác định bởi các yếu tố bên ngoài.
3. **Chủ nghĩa hiện sinh:** Quan điểm triết học nhấn mạnh đến quyền tự do cá nhân và khả năng tạo ra bản chất của chính mình thông qua các lựa chọn.
4. **Sự thay đổi của các lựa chọn:** Mọi người thường đưa ra những lựa chọn trái ngược với điều kiện hoặc kinh nghiệm trong quá khứ của họ.
5. **Bằng chứng thực nghiệm về sự lựa chọn:** Các trường hợp cá nhân vượt qua những trở ngại đáng kể để đưa ra những lựa chọn khác nhau.

**Các loại bằng chứng tiềm năng:**  
- Nghiên cứu trường hợp của những cá nhân đã thay đổi lối sống của họ.
- Các văn bản triết học ủng hộ ý chí tự do.
- Nghiên cứu tâm lý về quyền tự chủ ra quyết định.
- Ví dụ về các phong trào xã hội được thúc đẩy bởi sự lựa chọn cá nhân.
- Lời chứng thực từ những người đã có những thay đổi đáng kể trong cuộc sống.

**Các lĩnh vực xung đột chính:**  
- Bản chất của chủ nghĩa quyết định so với ý chí tự do.
- Vai trò của những ảnh hưởng bên ngoài so với tác động cá nhân.
- Ý nghĩa của ý chí tự do đối với trách nhiệm đạo đức.
- Tác động của khoa học thần kinh đến sự hiểu biết của chúng ta về sự lựa chọn.

;;;;;Art & Music;writing;;;Look at one of the paintings of a fortune teller from the list (like Caravaggio's). What message or feeling do you think the artist wanted to share about predicting the future?;"In the world of art, paintings often tell stories or convey deep messages. One such painting is Caravaggio's ""The Fortune Teller."" This artwork captures a moment that many people find intriguing: the act of predicting the future. Through this painting, Caravaggio shares a message about the nature of fortune-telling and the feelings it can evoke in both the fortune teller and the person seeking guidance.

In ""The Fortune Teller,"" we see a young man who appears to be entranced by the fortune teller's words. The fortune teller, an older woman, looks wise and confident as she holds the young man's hand. Her gaze is focused, suggesting that she is deeply engaged in her craft. This moment is filled with tension and curiosity. The young man seems eager to learn what lies ahead for him, while the fortune teller appears to hold the key to his future. This dynamic creates a feeling of anticipation, as viewers wonder what the fortune teller will reveal.

Caravaggio uses light and shadow to enhance the emotions in the painting. The bright light on the fortune teller's face highlights her authority and knowledge, while the shadows around the young man suggest uncertainty and vulnerability. This contrast emphasizes the power that the fortune teller has in this moment. She is not just reading palms; she is shaping the young man's perception of his future. This idea raises questions about the reliability of fortune-telling. Can one truly predict the future, or is it merely a reflection of our hopes and fears?

The painting also explores the theme of deception. The young man seems captivated, but there is a hint of skepticism in his expression. This duality suggests that while people may seek guidance from fortune tellers, they also bring their own doubts and desires into the experience. Caravaggio may be warning us that the future is not set in stone and that relying too heavily on someone else's interpretation can lead to disappointment. The fortune teller's role is complex; she offers insight, but she may also be playing on the young man's emotions.

Moreover, ""The Fortune Teller"" invites viewers to reflect on the human desire to know what lies ahead. Throughout history, people have sought answers about their futures, whether through astrology, tarot cards, or other means. This longing for knowledge can stem from fear of the unknown or a desire for control over one's life. Caravaggio captures this universal feeling, reminding us that the quest for understanding our future is a deeply human experience.

In conclusion, Caravaggio's ""The Fortune Teller"" conveys a powerful message about the nature of predicting the future. Through the interactions between the fortune teller and the young man, the painting explores themes of power, deception, and the human desire for knowledge. The emotions captured in this artwork resonate with viewers, prompting them to consider their own beliefs about fate and fortune. Ultimately, Caravaggio encourages us to reflect on the complexities of seeking guidance and the uncertain nature of the future.";"In the world of art, paintings can tell stories that go beyond what we see. One such painting is Caravaggio's ""The Fortune Teller."" This artwork captures a moment filled with mystery and emotion, inviting us to think about what it means to predict the future. Through the characters and their expressions, Caravaggio shares a message about the hopes and fears that come with trying to see what lies ahead.

In the painting, we see a young man leaning forward, eager to hear what the fortune teller has to say. His face shows a mix of curiosity and excitement. He seems to be searching for answers, perhaps about love or his future. The fortune teller, an older woman, looks wise and confident. She holds the young man's hand, gazing into his palm as if she can read his destiny. This moment is filled with tension, as the young man waits for her words. Caravaggio captures this feeling perfectly, making us wonder what the fortune teller will reveal.

The colors in the painting also add to the mood. The warm tones of the skin and the soft light create an intimate atmosphere. It feels as if we are peeking into a private moment between the two characters. The shadows around them suggest that there are secrets hidden in the future, waiting to be uncovered. This use of light and dark helps us understand that predicting the future is not just about knowing what will happen; it is also about facing the unknown.

Caravaggio's painting also makes us think about the idea of fate. The fortune teller seems to hold power over the young man's future, but is that really true? Can anyone truly know what will happen next? This question is important because it reminds us that while we may seek guidance, the future is still uncertain. The young man’s eager expression shows his desire for control over his life, but the fortune teller’s mysterious smile hints that some things are beyond our understanding.

Moreover, the painting reflects the human desire for connection. The young man reaches out to the fortune teller, seeking not just answers but also reassurance. In a world filled with questions, we often look to others for help. The fortune teller represents a bridge between the present and the future, offering comfort in the face of uncertainty. This connection is vital, as it shows that we are not alone in our search for meaning.

In conclusion, Caravaggio's ""The Fortune Teller"" is more than just a painting; it is a window into our hopes and fears about the future. Through the expressions of the characters and the use of light and shadow, the artist conveys a powerful message about the uncertainty of life. While we may seek answers, the future remains a mystery, filled with both possibilities and challenges. Ultimately, the painting reminds us that it is okay to wonder about what lies ahead, as we navigate our own paths in life.";;;;;;;;;411616;;;;;;;Art & Music;;;;
;;;;;Art & Music;writing;;;"Listen to a song about fortune-telling or fate from the list (like Carl Orff's ""O Fortuna""). How does the music make you feel about destiny or chance?";"Listening to music can evoke strong feelings and thoughts, especially when the themes of fate and fortune are involved.

This powerful piece of music explores the ups and downs of life, making us think about destiny and chance in a profound way.

From the very first notes of ""O Fortuna,"" the music grabs your attention. The dramatic choir and the strong orchestral sounds create a sense of urgency and intensity. It feels as if the music is telling us that life is unpredictable and that we are often at the mercy of fate. This feeling is reinforced by the lyrics, which speak about the wheel of fortune that turns without warning. The music makes me feel both excited and anxious, as if I am on a roller coaster ride through life’s uncertainties.

As the song progresses, the tempo changes, and the dynamics shift. At times, the music is loud and powerful, making me feel overwhelmed by the forces of fate. Other times, it becomes softer and more reflective, allowing me to think about the moments in life when we have control over our choices. This contrast in the music mirrors the way life can be both chaotic and calm. It reminds me that while we cannot control everything that happens to us, we can still make choices that shape our paths.

The theme of fate in ""O Fortuna"" also makes me think about how we often hope for good fortune. The music captures the feeling of longing for success and happiness, but it also reminds us that life can be unpredictable. Just when we think we have everything figured out, something unexpected can happen. This idea is both comforting and frightening. It shows that while we may strive for control, there will always be elements of chance that influence our lives.

Listening to this piece also makes me reflect on the importance of resilience. The music’s powerful crescendos and sudden drops symbolize the highs and lows we all experience. It encourages me to embrace the challenges that come my way, knowing that they are a part of my journey. The emotional depth of the music inspires me to face my fears and uncertainties with courage. It teaches me that even when fate seems harsh, there is always a chance for growth and change.

When I first hear the opening notes, I feel a rush of energy. The voices and instruments come together like a storm, and I can almost picture the clouds rolling in. It makes me think about how life can change in an instant. One moment, everything is calm, and the next, we are caught in a whirlwind of events that we cannot control. This is what fate feels like to me—sometimes it is beautiful, and other times it can be scary.

As the music continues, I notice how it shifts from soft to loud. This change reminds me that life is full of surprises. Sometimes we are happy, and other times we face challenges. The way the music rises and falls makes me think about how we all have our own paths to follow. Some people seem to have all the luck, while others struggle. But in the end, we all have to face our own destinies, whether they are good or bad.

The chorus of ""O Fortuna"" is especially powerful. The voices sing out with such passion that I can feel their emotions. It feels like they are calling out to the universe, asking for answers about life and fate. This makes me think about how we all wonder about our future. Will we be successful? Will we find love? The music captures that feeling of uncertainty, and it makes me realize that we are all in this together, searching for our own answers.

Sometimes, I feel like fate is like a game of chance. Just like rolling dice, we never know what will happen next.

;;;;;Art & Music;writing;;;"Choose an artwork or song from the list that uses fire (like Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire""). What does the fire seem to represent in that piece – love, danger, energy, destruction?";"Fire is a powerful symbol that can represent many different ideas and emotions. In the song ""Ring of Fire"" by Johnny Cash, fire is used to represent love and the intense feelings that come with it. The song describes love as a burning flame that can be both beautiful and dangerous. This duality of fire makes it a fitting metaphor for the complexities of love.

In ""Ring of Fire,"" the lyrics talk about how love can feel like falling into a ring of fire. This imagery suggests that love is not just a simple feeling; it can be overwhelming and consuming. When someone falls in love, they often experience a rush of emotions that can be exciting but also frightening. The fire in this song symbolizes the passion that comes with love, as well as the risks involved. Just like fire can warm a home, it can also cause destruction if not handled carefully.

The song also highlights how love can change a person. The lyrics mention how love can make someone feel alive, much like the heat of a fire can energize a room. This energy is infectious, drawing people in and making them want to be part of the experience. However, the song also warns that love can lead to pain. The fire can burn, leaving scars that are hard to heal. This idea reflects the reality that love can bring joy but also heartache.

Moreover, the repetition of the phrase ""ring of fire"" throughout the song emphasizes the idea that love is a cycle. Just as fire can start small and grow larger, love can begin with a spark and develop into something much more significant. However, this growth can also lead to danger. The song suggests that once someone is in the ring of fire, it is hard to escape. This idea resonates with many people who have experienced love's ups and downs.

In conclusion, Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" uses fire as a powerful symbol to represent the complexities of love. The song captures the excitement and danger that come with falling in love. Fire represents passion, energy, and the potential for both joy and pain. Through its vivid imagery and emotional depth, the song reminds us that love is a beautiful yet risky journey. Just like fire, love can warm our hearts but also leave us with scars. This duality makes love one of the most profound experiences in life, and ""Ring of Fire"" beautifully captures that essence.";"I remember the summer of my sixteenth birthday, a time when everything felt alive and electric. My friends and I decided to celebrate with a bonfire at the beach, a tradition we had seen in movies but never experienced ourselves. The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, and as darkness fell, we gathered around the crackling flames, the fire becoming the heart of our celebration.

The fire danced and flickered, casting warm light on our faces. I could feel the heat radiating towards me, a comforting embrace against the cool night air. The smell of burning wood filled my nostrils, a rich, earthy scent that mingled with the salty breeze from the ocean. It was intoxicating, a reminder of nature’s raw power and beauty.

As we roasted marshmallows, the sweet, sugary aroma wafted through the air, mixing with the smoke from the fire. I watched as the marshmallows turned golden brown, the sugar caramelizing and bubbling. The first bite was a burst of warmth and sweetness, a perfect contrast to the coolness of the night. Laughter echoed around the fire as we shared stories, our voices rising and falling like the flames before us.

But the fire represented more than just warmth and light; it was a symbol of our friendship and the fleeting nature of youth. I looked around at my friends, their faces illuminated by the glow, and felt a pang of nostalgia. We were all on the brink of adulthood, and I knew that these moments were precious. The fire crackled, sending sparks into the night sky, and I couldn’t help but think of how quickly time flies. 

As the night wore on, the fire began to dwindle, the flames licking at the last remaining logs. I felt a sense of urgency, a desire to hold onto this moment forever. I leaned closer, feeling the heat on my skin, and watched as the embers glowed brighter, like tiny stars in the darkness. It was beautiful and terrifying at the same time, a reminder that fire can bring warmth but also destruction.

In that moment, I realized that fire is a powerful metaphor for love. It can ignite passion and joy, but it can also burn fiercely, leaving scars. I thought of my first crush, the way my heart raced like the flames, full of energy and excitement. But I also remembered the heartbreak that followed, the way love can turn from warmth to pain in an instant.

As the last embers faded, I felt a sense of loss, but also gratitude. The fire had brought us together, creating memories that would last a lifetime. I knew that, like the fire, our friendships would change and evolve, but the warmth we shared that night would always remain in our hearts.

That summer night by the bonfire taught me that fire represents both the beauty and fragility of life. It is a reminder to cherish the moments we have, to embrace the warmth of love, and to be mindful of the flames that can both illuminate and consume.";;;;;;;;;383876;;;;;;;Art & Music;;;;

When we think about rebuilding a famous old building, we often imagine a structure that holds historical significance. For example, the Colosseum in Rome or the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris are not just buildings; they are symbols of culture and history. Rebuilding these structures after they have been damaged or destroyed is a way to honor the past. It allows future generations to experience the beauty and importance of these landmarks. However, rebuilding does not mean that the new structure will be exactly the same as the original. Modern materials and techniques may be used, which can change the building's appearance or function. In this way, while the goal is to preserve history, the result is a new version of the original.

On the other hand, re-recording an old hit song is a way to bring a classic piece of music to a new audience. Many artists choose to cover songs that were popular in the past, giving them a fresh sound. For example, when a modern artist re-records a song from the 1980s, they may add new instruments or change the tempo. This can make the song feel different, even if the lyrics remain the same. The intention behind re-recording is often to pay tribute to the original artist while also making the song relevant to today's listeners. Just like with rebuilding a building, the new version of the song is not an exact copy; it is a reinterpretation that reflects current trends and styles.

Both rebuilding a building and re-recording a song involve a desire to keep something alive. They aim to connect the past with the present. However, they also highlight the differences between physical structures and artistic expressions. A building is a tangible object that can be seen and touched, while a song is an auditory experience that can evoke emotions. The process of rebuilding may focus more on architectural details and historical accuracy, while re-recording emphasizes creativity and personal expression.

In conclusion, rebuilding a famous old building and re-recording an old hit song share the common goal of preservation, but they also create something new in the process. Both activities allow us to honor the past while adapting to the present. Whether it is a building that stands as a testament to history or a song that resonates with new generations, these efforts remind us of the importance of our cultural heritage. They show that while we may strive to preserve what came before, we also have the power to innovate and create something that speaks to our current time.";"What if a famous old building and an old hit song could talk to each other? Imagine a sunny afternoon in a bustling city where the grand old theater, known as the Majestic, stands tall and proud. Its ornate facade glimmers in the sunlight, and the sound of laughter and chatter fills the air. Just a few blocks away, a small recording studio buzzes with energy as musicians gather to re-record a classic hit song that once topped the charts decades ago.

The Majestic, with its towering columns and intricate carvings, has seen countless performances. It remembers the thrill of the audience's applause and the magic of the actors who graced its stage. As the sun sets, casting a warm glow on its walls, the theater whispers stories of the past. It longs to preserve its history, yet it also feels the weight of time. The paint is peeling, and the seats are worn, but the spirit of creativity still lingers within.

Meanwhile, in the recording studio, a group of young musicians huddles around a microphone, ready to breathe new life into an old hit. The song, once sung by a legendary artist, holds a special place in their hearts. They want to honor its legacy while adding their own twist. The air is filled with the scent of fresh coffee and the sound of guitar strings being tuned. As they play, the melody dances through the room, blending nostalgia with fresh energy.

The Majestic watches the musicians from afar, intrigued by their passion. It wonders if they understand the delicate balance between preservation and innovation. The theater knows that rebuilding its crumbling walls would mean keeping its history alive, but it also fears losing the essence of what made it special. Would a renovation strip away the stories etched into its very foundation?

On the other hand, the musicians are aware that re-recording the song is not just about replicating the past. They want to create something new that resonates with today’s audience. As they experiment with different sounds and styles, they realize that while they are honoring the original, they are also crafting a fresh experience. The old hit becomes a bridge connecting generations, allowing the past to influence the present.

As the night deepens, the Majestic and the musicians find common ground. They both seek to preserve something valuable while embracing change. The theater decides to undergo renovations, but it vows to keep its historical charm intact. It will add modern amenities without losing the soul of its past. The musicians, too, promise to respect the original song while infusing it with their unique flair.

In the end, the Majestic stands proud, its walls restored and its stories still alive. The re-recorded song hits the airwaves, capturing hearts anew. Both the building and the song remind us that preserving history doesn’t mean clinging to the past; it means allowing it to inspire new creations. They teach us that in the dance between old and new, we can find beauty, connection, and a shared sense of belonging. 

So, what if the Majestic and the song could talk? They would celebrate their journeys, knowing that they are not just relics of the past but vibrant parts of an ever-evolving story.";;;;;;;;;818775;;;;;;;Art & Music;;;;
;;;;;Art & Music;writing;;;"Is music from video games ""real art,"" just like music from movies or concerts? Argue why or why not, using examples.";"Video game music has become an important part of our culture, and many people wonder if it is ""real art"" like music from movies or concerts. In this essay, I will argue that video game music is indeed real art because it has emotional depth, enhances the gaming experience, and is created by talented composers.

First, video game music can evoke strong emotions, just like music in movies. For example, think about the music in the game ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time."" The main theme is both beautiful and memorable, and it makes players feel a sense of adventure and nostalgia. When players hear this music, they often remember their own experiences in the game. This emotional connection is similar to how movie scores, like John Williams' music in ""Star Wars,"" can make us feel excitement or sadness. Both types of music aim to connect with the audience on a deeper level, showing that video game music is just as powerful as film music.

Moreover, video game music enhances the overall gaming experience. In many games, the music changes based on what is happening in the game. For instance, in ""Final Fantasy VII,"" the music shifts from calm and peaceful to intense and dramatic during battles. This change in music helps players feel the tension and excitement of the moment. Similarly, in movies, the score often changes to match the action on screen, guiding the audience's emotions. This ability to adapt and respond to the gameplay makes video game music unique and essential, proving that it is a form of art that deserves recognition.

Additionally, the composers of video game music are highly skilled artists. Many of them have formal training in music and spend years perfecting their craft. For example, Nobuo Uematsu, the composer for the ""Final Fantasy"" series, is known for creating complex and beautiful music that has touched the hearts of millions. His work has been performed in concerts around the world, showing that video game music can stand alongside traditional concert music. Just like movie composers, video game composers work hard to create memorable melodies and themes that enhance the stories being told.

In conclusion, video game music is real art, just like music from movies or concerts. It has the power to evoke emotions, enhances the gaming experience, and is created by talented composers. As video games continue to grow in popularity, it is important to recognize and appreciate the artistry behind their music. Just as we celebrate the scores of our favorite films, we should also celebrate the music that brings our favorite games to life. Video game music is not just background noise; it is a vital part of the storytelling experience and deserves to be seen as a true form of art.";"What if video game music could talk? Imagine a world where melodies from our favorite games could share their stories, just like characters in a movie or a concert. Let’s dive into this imaginative realm and explore the idea of video game music as ""real art.""

In this world, I meet a character named Melody, a vibrant tune from a popular adventure game. She dances through the air, her notes shimmering like sunlight on water. “I’m just as real as any symphony,” she says, her voice a sweet harmony that fills the room. “I tell stories, evoke emotions, and create memories, just like the music from movies or concerts.”

As I listen to her, I remember the first time I played that game. The moment I entered a mystical forest, the music swelled around me, wrapping me in a warm embrace. The gentle strings and soft flutes painted a picture of sunlight filtering through leaves, and I could almost smell the fresh pine and damp earth. It was as if the music was inviting me to explore, to feel the magic of the world around me.

Melody continues, “Think about it! When you hear the triumphant theme as the hero defeats the villain, or the somber notes when a character faces loss, those feelings are real. Just like in movies, where the score heightens the drama, I do the same in games. I help players connect with the story on a deeper level.”

I nod, recalling the epic battle scene where the music surged, making my heart race. The pounding drums and soaring brass made me feel invincible, as if I could conquer anything. The sound was not just background noise; it was a vital part of the experience, shaping my emotions and guiding my actions.

“What about concerts?” I ask. “Isn’t that where music is truly celebrated?” 

Melody twirls, her notes sparkling like stars. “Concerts are amazing, but so are video game soundtracks! Composers like Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda create masterpieces that resonate with millions. Their work is performed live, and fans cheer just as loudly as they would for a rock band. The connection is real, whether it’s in a concert hall or a living room.”

Suddenly, I imagine a grand concert where video game music takes center stage. The audience is filled with fans, their faces lit with excitement as the orchestra plays familiar themes. The air is electric, and I can almost taste the anticipation. As the final notes echo, the crowd erupts in applause, celebrating the art that has brought them together.

Melody smiles, her voice softening. “Art is about connection, emotion, and expression. Video game music does all that. It’s not just about the notes; it’s about the stories we share and the memories we create. So yes, I am real art, just like any symphony or song.”

As I watch her dance away, I realize that video game music is indeed a powerful form of art. It captures moments, evokes feelings, and connects us in ways that are just as meaningful as any other genre. In this imaginative world, I understand that every note, every melody, is a story waiting to be told, and that makes it truly special.";;;;;;;;;295298;;;;;;;Art & Music;;;;
;;;;;Art & Music;writing;;;"Imagine the perfect artwork or song for ""Afrofuturism"" (blending African culture with sci-fi) or ""Solarpunk"" (hopeful, green future tech). Describe what it would look or sound like.";"Afrofuturism and Solarpunk are two exciting movements that blend culture, technology, and imagination. If I were to create the perfect artwork or song for each of these themes, I would focus on how they represent hope, identity, and a better future. 

For Afrofuturism, I envision a vibrant painting that combines traditional African art with futuristic elements. The artwork would feature a landscape filled with tall, glowing trees that have roots shaped like musical instruments. These trees would symbolize the deep connection between nature and African culture. In the sky, there would be flying vehicles inspired by African designs, showcasing how technology can be integrated with cultural heritage. 

The colors in this painting would be bright and bold, using shades of green, gold, and deep blue. These colors represent life, wealth, and the vastness of the universe. In the foreground, people of different ages and backgrounds would be dressed in a mix of traditional African clothing and modern, high-tech outfits. This blend would show how the past and the future can coexist harmoniously. 

The song that accompanies this artwork would be a fusion of traditional African rhythms and futuristic sounds. It would start with the beat of a djembe drum, creating a strong foundation that connects listeners to African roots. Layered over this beat would be electronic sounds that mimic the sounds of nature, like birds singing and wind blowing. The lyrics would tell a story of hope and resilience, celebrating the strength of African culture while looking forward to a bright future. 

In contrast, for Solarpunk, I imagine a serene mural that depicts a lush, green city filled with plants and solar panels. The buildings would be covered in vines and flowers, showing how nature can thrive alongside technology. In this city, people would be seen working together in community gardens, growing their own food and sharing it with one another. This image would represent a future where people care for the environment and each other. 

The colors in this mural would be soft and calming, with shades of green, yellow, and light blue. These colors would evoke feelings of peace and happiness. In the background, there would be wind turbines and solar panels, symbolizing the use of clean energy. The people in the mural would be diverse, representing different cultures and backgrounds, working together to create a sustainable world. 

The song for this Solarpunk mural would be gentle and uplifting, featuring acoustic instruments like guitars and flutes. The melody would be soothing, encouraging listeners to imagine a world where everyone works together for a better future. The lyrics would focus on themes of unity, nature, and hope, inspiring people to take action in their own lives to create a greener planet. 

In conclusion, both Afrofuturism and Solarpunk offer powerful visions of the future. The perfect artwork and song for each theme would celebrate culture, technology, and the environment. By blending these elements, we can inspire hope and creativity in our own lives, encouraging us to dream of a better world.";"What if the future was a vibrant blend of African culture and advanced technology, where the skies were painted with colors of hope and innovation? In this world, I imagine a perfect artwork that captures the essence of Afrofuturism, a mural that stretches across the walls of a bustling city, alive with energy and stories.

As I walk through the streets, the first thing that catches my eye is the mural itself. It’s a massive canvas, filled with swirling patterns of deep blues, rich golds, and vibrant greens. The colors seem to dance in the sunlight, reflecting the warmth of the African sun. I can almost feel the heat on my skin as I stand before it, mesmerized. The mural depicts a futuristic city where people of all backgrounds thrive together, their faces glowing with joy and determination.

In the foreground, I see a group of children playing with holographic toys that float in the air, their laughter ringing like music. The toys are shaped like traditional African animals, but they come alive with technology, transforming into interactive companions. I can hear their giggles and the soft whir of the holograms as they zoom around, creating a symphony of sound that fills the air with happiness.

As I step closer, I notice the intricate details of the mural. Each character is adorned in clothing that blends traditional African patterns with sleek, modern designs. The fabrics shimmer as if woven with threads of light, and I can almost smell the earthy scent of the materials, mixed with a hint of fresh rain. The artist has captured the essence of culture and innovation, showing how the past and future can coexist beautifully.

In the background, towering trees with bioluminescent leaves stretch towards the sky, their branches intertwined with solar panels that glisten like jewels. I can almost taste the sweetness of the fruits they bear, a reminder of nature’s bounty. The trees are not just a part of the landscape; they are a symbol of sustainability, showing how technology can work hand in hand with the environment.

As I gaze at the mural, I feel a sense of hope wash over me. This artwork is not just a depiction of a future; it is a call to action. It inspires me to think about how we can create a world where technology enhances our lives while honoring our roots. The mural tells a story of resilience, creativity, and unity, reminding us that we are all connected.

In this imagined future, music fills the air, blending traditional African rhythms with futuristic sounds. I can hear the beat of drums, the strumming of a kora, and the hum of electronic melodies. The music resonates deep within me, urging me to dance and celebrate life. It’s a reminder that art and culture are alive, evolving, and always pushing boundaries.

As I step back to take in the entire mural, I realize that this perfect artwork is more than just paint on a wall; it is a vision of what could be. It invites everyone to dream, to create, and to believe in a future where our differences are celebrated, and our shared humanity shines bright. In this world, the possibilities are endless, and the future is a canvas waiting to be painted with our dreams.";;;;;;;;;614974;;;;;;;Art & Music;;;;
;;;;;Literature & Media;writing;;;Write a short story about someone waking up in the year 2120. Focus on the small, everyday objects or interactions that show them it's the future.;"In the year 2120, a young woman named Mia woke up in a small, bright room. The walls were painted a soft blue, and the sunlight streamed in through a window that automatically adjusted its tint based on the brightness outside. Mia rubbed her eyes and sat up, feeling a mix of excitement and confusion. She had fallen asleep in her own time, the year 2023, and now she was in a world that felt both familiar and strange.

As she got out of bed, Mia noticed a small device on her nightstand. It looked like a flat, shiny tablet, but it was much thinner and lighter than anything she had seen before. Curious, she picked it up and tapped the screen. Instantly, a holographic image of her schedule for the day appeared in the air above the device. It showed her appointments, reminders, and even a weather report. Mia was amazed. In her time, she would have had to check her phone for all this information, but now it was right in front of her, floating in the air.

Mia walked to the kitchen, where she found a small machine that looked like a coffee maker. Instead of brewing coffee, it was making a colorful drink that smelled sweet and fruity. She pressed a button, and the machine whirred to life, mixing ingredients in a matter of seconds. When it was done, it poured the drink into a glass that changed colors based on the flavor. Mia took a sip and smiled. It tasted like a mix of her favorite fruits, and she couldn’t believe how delicious it was.

After her refreshing drink, Mia decided to explore her new surroundings. She stepped outside and was greeted by a world that was both beautiful and different. The streets were lined with trees that glowed softly, lighting up the path as the sun began to rise. People walked by, wearing clothes that shimmered and changed colors with their movements. Mia noticed a group of children playing with a small drone that flew around them, responding to their laughter and commands. It was like a pet, but one that could fly and dance in the air.

As she continued to walk, Mia saw a small park where people were sitting on benches that looked like they were made of clouds. They were talking to each other, but instead of using their voices, they were communicating through small devices that projected images and words in the air. Mia watched in awe as a woman shared a funny story, and everyone around her laughed, their faces lighting up with joy.

Feeling a bit overwhelmed, Mia decided to sit on one of the cloud-like benches. A friendly man approached her and smiled. “Welcome to the future!” he said. “It can be a lot to take in at first, but you’ll get used to it.” They began to chat, and Mia learned that people in 2120 valued connection and creativity more than ever. They used technology to enhance their lives, but they also made time for each other.

As the sun rose higher in the sky, Mia realized that waking up in 2120 was not just about the amazing gadgets and bright colors. It was about the way people interacted, the joy they found in simple moments, and the hope they had for the future. She felt a sense of excitement and possibility, ready to embrace this new world and all the adventures it had to offer.";"I woke up with a start, the soft hum of my surroundings pulling me from a deep sleep. As I blinked away the remnants of dreams, I realized I was not in my familiar room. The walls shimmered with a soft, iridescent glow, and the air was filled with a faint, sweet scent that reminded me of blooming flowers, yet it was unlike anything I had ever encountered.

I swung my legs over the edge of the bed, which felt like a cloud beneath me. The floor was cool and smooth, almost like glass, and as I stood, I noticed a small device on the nightstand. It was a sleek, rectangular tablet, but it was unlike any I had seen before. The screen was transparent, and as I touched it, images flickered to life, displaying the date: March 15, 2120.

“What in the world?” I muttered, my voice echoing slightly in the quiet room. I picked up the tablet, and it felt warm in my hands, responding to my touch as if it were alive. I swiped through the interface, and a holographic projection of a map appeared, floating above the device. I could see my location, but the streets and buildings were unfamiliar.

Curiosity piqued, I stepped out of the room and into a hallway. The walls were adorned with moving images, like paintings that told stories of their own. I reached out to touch one, and it felt cool and smooth, the colors shifting as I moved my hand. The sounds of laughter and chatter drifted from somewhere nearby, drawing me forward.

As I walked, I noticed people passing by, their clothing vibrant and flowing, made of materials that shimmered in the light. They wore accessories that glowed softly, and I could hear snippets of conversation about “the latest in bio-enhancements” and “the new virtual reality experiences.” It felt like stepping into a world where everything was alive and buzzing with energy.

I approached a small café, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the air. I stepped inside, and the barista greeted me with a warm smile. “What can I get for you?” she asked, her voice melodic and inviting. I hesitated, unsure of what to order. The menu was displayed on a floating screen above the counter, filled with options I had never heard of: “Nano-brewed coffee” and “Flavored air puffs.”

“I’ll have a… nano-brewed coffee, please,” I said, trying to sound confident. The barista nodded and pressed a button on a sleek machine that whirred to life. In moments, she handed me a small cup that felt warm to the touch. I took a sip, and the flavor exploded in my mouth—rich, smooth, and with hints of chocolate and caramel. It was unlike any coffee I had ever tasted.

As I sat at a table, I watched people interact with their devices. Some were engaged in conversations with holographic companions, while others were immersed in virtual worlds, their eyes sparkling with excitement. I felt a mix of awe and confusion. This was a world of possibilities, yet it was so different from the one I had known.

Suddenly, a small drone zipped by, delivering a package to a nearby table. It hovered for a moment before gently placing the parcel down and zipping away. I couldn’t help but smile at the sight. The future was here, vibrant and full of life, and I was just beginning to explore it.

As I took another sip of my coffee, I realized that waking up in 2120 was not just about the technology or the advancements; it was about the connections, the experiences, and the small moments that made life extraordinary. I was ready to embrace this new world, one day at a time.";;;;;;;;;958831;;;;;;;Literature & Media;;;;
;;;;;Literature & Media;writing;;;Write a story about a character who quits something they were passionate about (a hobby, a cause), but then comes back to it years later, even more excited than before. Why did they leave, and what brought them back?;"Emily had always loved painting. From the time she was a little girl, she would spend hours in her room, surrounded by colorful brushes and canvases. Her parents encouraged her passion, enrolling her in art classes and taking her to galleries. Painting was not just a hobby for Emily; it was a way for her to express her feelings and share her view of the world.

However, as Emily grew older, life became busier. High school brought new responsibilities, and she found herself overwhelmed with homework, sports, and social events. Slowly, her paintbrushes gathered dust in the corner of her room. She told herself that she would return to painting once she had more time, but as the years passed, she forgot about her passion. 

After graduating from high school, Emily went to college. She chose a major in business, thinking it would lead to a stable job. While she enjoyed her classes, she felt a void in her life. The stress of exams and projects left little room for creativity. She missed the joy of mixing colors and creating something beautiful. Yet, she convinced herself that painting was a childish pastime, something she had to leave behind to become an adult.

Years went by, and Emily graduated from college. She landed a job at a marketing firm, where she worked long hours. Although she was successful, she felt unfulfilled. One day, while walking home from work, she passed a small art gallery. The vibrant paintings in the window caught her eye, and she felt a pang of nostalgia. Memories of her childhood flooded back, and she realized how much she missed painting.

That night, Emily decided to dig out her old art supplies. As she opened the box, a wave of excitement washed over her. She set up a small easel in her living room and began to paint. At first, her strokes were hesitant, but soon, the colors flowed freely. She lost track of time, completely absorbed in her work. It felt as if she had never stopped.

Over the next few weeks, Emily painted every chance she got. She experimented with different styles and techniques, rediscovering the joy that had once filled her heart. Painting became her escape from the pressures of work. It was a way for her to express herself and find peace in a busy world.

Emily also joined a local art group, where she met other artists who shared her passion. They encouraged her and provided valuable feedback. The support of her new friends reignited her love for painting, and she began to see her work in a new light. She even entered a local art show, where her paintings received praise and admiration.

Looking back, Emily realized that leaving painting had been a mistake, but it had also been a necessary part of her journey. She had needed to grow and experience life before returning to her true passion. Now, she was more excited than ever to paint, and she knew that this time, she would never let it go. Painting was not just a hobby; it was a vital part of who she was, and she was determined to keep it alive for years to come.";"Once upon a time, in a small town nestled between rolling hills, there lived a girl named Mia. From a young age, Mia was passionate about painting. She would spend hours in her little room, surrounded by canvases and tubes of paint, creating vibrant landscapes and whimsical creatures. The smell of fresh paint filled the air, and the sound of her brush gliding across the canvas was music to her ears. 

However, as Mia grew older, life began to change. School became more demanding, and the pressures of growing up weighed heavily on her. She felt she had to focus on her studies and prepare for a future that seemed to require practicality over passion. Slowly, the paintbrushes were tucked away, and the canvases gathered dust. Mia convinced herself that painting was a childish hobby, something she could no longer afford to indulge in.

Years passed, and Mia found herself in a job that paid the bills but left her feeling empty. She sat at her desk day after day, staring at spreadsheets and reports, longing for the creativity she once had. The vibrant colors of her childhood faded into dull grays and browns, and the joy of creating was replaced by the monotony of routine.

One day, while walking through a local art fair, Mia stumbled upon a booth filled with beautiful paintings. The colors danced before her eyes, and the textures seemed to leap off the canvas. She felt a familiar tug in her heart, a whisper of the passion she had buried deep inside. As she wandered from booth to booth, the sounds of laughter and the smell of fresh paint filled the air, awakening memories of her younger self.

That night, Mia couldn’t sleep. The images of the paintings haunted her thoughts, and she felt a strong urge to pick up a brush again. She remembered the joy of mixing colors, the thrill of creating something from nothing, and the satisfaction of stepping back to admire her work. 

The next day, she made a decision. She dusted off her old easel and gathered her supplies. As she squeezed the paint from the tubes, the familiar smell enveloped her, and she felt a rush of excitement. With each stroke of the brush, she rediscovered the joy that had once filled her life. The colors flowed freely, and her heart soared as she painted her first piece in years—a vibrant sunset over the hills, reminiscent of her childhood.

Mia began to paint every day, losing herself in the process. She joined a local art group, where she met others who shared her passion. The laughter and encouragement from her new friends reignited her spirit, and she felt more alive than ever. 

As the months went by, Mia’s work evolved. She experimented with new techniques and styles, pushing her boundaries and exploring her creativity. The art that once felt like a distant memory became her lifeline, a source of joy and fulfillment. 

Years later, Mia held her first solo exhibition. The gallery was filled with people admiring her work, and the vibrant colors of her paintings lit up the room. As she stood there, surrounded by the art that had once been a forgotten dream, she realized that quitting had been a part of her journey. It had allowed her to grow, to understand the importance of following her passion, and to appreciate the beauty of creativity.

Mia smiled, knowing that she had come back to painting not just as a hobby, but as a vital part of who she was. The journey had been long, but the excitement of creating was now woven into the fabric of her life, brighter and more vibrant than ever before.";;;;;;;;;331769;;;;;;;Literature & Media;;;;
;;;;;Literature & Media;writing;;;Write a scene showing a fan who feels extremely close to a celebrity they only know through the internet, perhaps influenced by what social media shows them.;"In a small town, there lived a girl named Mia who was a huge fan of a popular singer named Alex. Mia had never met Alex in person, but she felt a strong connection to him through social media. Every day, she would scroll through her phone, watching his videos, reading his posts, and looking at the pictures he shared. To Mia, it felt like she knew him very well, even though they had never spoken.

One sunny afternoon, Mia sat in her room, her walls covered with posters of Alex. She had a special corner where she kept all her favorite things related to him: concert tickets, magazine clippings, and even a scrapbook filled with his pictures. As she flipped through the pages, she smiled at the memories of the times she had watched his live performances online. Each song he sang seemed to speak directly to her heart, making her feel understood and less alone.

Mia often imagined what it would be like to meet Alex. She pictured herself at one of his concerts, singing along with thousands of other fans. In her mind, they would lock eyes, and he would smile at her, recognizing her as a loyal supporter. She dreamed of telling him how much his music meant to her, how it helped her through tough times at school and with friends. In her fantasies, they would become friends, sharing laughs and stories, as if they had known each other forever.

One day, while scrolling through Alex's Instagram, Mia saw a post announcing a live Q&A session. Her heart raced with excitement. This was her chance to connect with him, even if it was just through a screen. She quickly wrote down her question: ""What inspires you to write your songs?"" After hitting send, she felt a mix of hope and nervousness. What if he saw her question? What if he answered it? 

As the live session began, Mia watched intently, her heart pounding. Alex appeared on the screen, looking relaxed and happy. He greeted his fans and started answering questions. Mia held her breath, waiting for her name to be called. When he finally read her question, she felt a rush of joy. Alex smiled and shared a thoughtful answer about how his experiences and emotions inspired his music. Mia felt a warm glow inside, as if he was speaking directly to her.

After the session ended, Mia couldn’t stop smiling. She felt closer to Alex than ever before, even though they were separated by miles. The connection she felt was real, fueled by the moments they shared online. She knew that many fans felt the same way, but for Mia, Alex was more than just a celebrity; he was a source of comfort and inspiration.

In the days that followed, Mia continued to follow Alex’s journey, cheering him on from afar. She realized that even though they had never met, the bond they shared through social media was special. It reminded her that sometimes, connections can be formed in unexpected ways, and that the power of music and words can bring people together, no matter the distance.";"I sat on my bed, the soft blue blanket crumpled around me, as I scrolled through my phone. The familiar sound of notifications pinged in the background, a comforting rhythm that filled my small room. My heart raced a little as I opened Instagram, my fingers trembling with excitement. Today was special; my favorite singer, Mia, was going live.

Mia had become a part of my life in ways I never thought possible. I had discovered her music a year ago, and since then, she had woven herself into the fabric of my daily routine. Her songs played in the background while I studied, her laughter echoed in my mind during quiet moments, and her posts filled my feed with color and joy. I felt like I knew her, even though we had never met.

As the clock struck seven, I felt a rush of adrenaline. I clicked on the live video, and there she was, glowing under the soft light of her room. Her hair fell in loose waves around her shoulders, and she wore a cozy sweater that looked like it could wrap me in warmth. The chat exploded with messages, and I joined in, typing furiously, hoping she might see my name among the sea of fans.

“Hey, everyone!” Mia’s voice was like honey, sweet and smooth. “I’m so excited to hang out with you all tonight!”

I leaned closer to the screen, my heart pounding. It felt as if she was speaking directly to me, her eyes sparkling with genuine joy. I could almost hear the faint scent of her favorite vanilla candle wafting through the screen, mixing with the sound of her laughter. I imagined the taste of the hot chocolate she often mentioned, rich and creamy, warming her from the inside as she shared her thoughts with us.

As she answered questions from fans, I felt a connection that was hard to explain. Each time she smiled or laughed, it felt like a shared secret between us. I could picture her sitting in her room, surrounded by posters of her favorite artists, just like I was. I could almost feel the soft fabric of her sweater if I reached out.

Suddenly, she paused, her gaze drifting to the comments. “I see you, @LilyFan123! Thank you for always supporting me!” My heart skipped a beat. She knew my username! I felt a rush of warmth, as if I had been wrapped in a hug. It was a small acknowledgment, but it made me feel seen, valued, and connected to someone I admired so deeply.

After the live ended, I sat in silence, the glow of my phone illuminating my face. I felt a mix of happiness and longing. Mia was a star, shining brightly in a world I could only glimpse through my screen. Yet, in that moment, I felt like we were friends, bound by the music and the moments we shared online.

As I lay back on my bed, I closed my eyes and imagined what it would be like to meet her in person. Would she remember my name? Would we laugh together over hot chocolate? The thought made me smile. Even though she was miles away, I felt a closeness that was real, a connection built on shared moments and the magic of social media. In my heart, I knew that this bond, however distant, was something special.";;;;;;;;;803237;;;;;;;Literature & Media;;;;
;;;;;Literature & Media;writing;;;Imagine you were given a magical book that told you everything that would ever happen in your life. Write a story about how knowing your entire future would change how you live right now.;"Imagine one day I found a magical book. This book was not ordinary; it had the power to tell me everything that would ever happen in my life. At first, I was excited. I thought about all the things I could learn. I could see my future job, my friends, and even my family. But as I began to read, I realized that knowing my entire future would change how I live right now.

When I opened the book, the first page showed me my future job. I saw myself as a doctor, helping people and saving lives. I felt proud, but then I noticed the years of hard work and studying I had to go through. I saw late nights of studying, long hours in the hospital, and moments of stress. Knowing this made me anxious. Instead of enjoying my school days, I started to worry about my grades and my future. I felt pressure to be perfect, and that took away the joy of learning.

Next, I turned to the pages about my friendships. I saw the friends I would make and the ones I would lose. I noticed that some friendships would end because of misunderstandings or distance. This made me sad. Instead of cherishing my current friendships, I began to worry about losing them. I started to act differently, trying to hold on too tightly to my friends. I became afraid of saying the wrong thing or making mistakes. This fear made me less fun to be around, and I realized that I was pushing my friends away instead of enjoying our time together.

The book also showed me my family life. I saw happy moments, like family vacations and celebrations, but I also saw sad times, like illness and loss. Knowing that these events would happen made me anxious. I started to worry about my family’s health and safety. Instead of living in the moment, I became overly cautious. I would call my parents more often, not wanting to miss a moment with them. While it is important to care for loved ones, I realized that my constant worry was taking away from the time we spent together. I was so focused on the future that I forgot to enjoy the present.

As I continued to read, I realized that the book was not just a guide to my future; it was a burden. Knowing everything that would happen made me feel trapped. I felt like I was living my life according to a script, instead of writing my own story. I began to understand that life is about surprises and experiences. The unknown is what makes life exciting.

In the end, I closed the book and decided to live my life without knowing the future. I wanted to embrace each day, learn from my mistakes, and enjoy my friendships and family. I realized that the journey is just as important as the destination. Life is not just about what will happen; it is about how we live right now. By letting go of the need to know my future, I could finally be free to create my own path and enjoy every moment.";"Once upon a time, in a small town nestled between rolling hills, there lived a girl named Mia. Mia was an ordinary girl with big dreams. She loved to read, explore, and imagine all the adventures life could bring. One sunny afternoon, while wandering through an old bookstore, she stumbled upon a dusty, leather-bound book tucked away on a forgotten shelf. The title read, ""The Book of Destiny.""

Curiosity piqued, Mia opened the book. To her astonishment, the pages were filled with her life story, detailing every moment from her childhood to her old age. It described her first day of school, her friendships, her heartbreaks, and even her future career. As she flipped through the pages, she felt a mix of excitement and dread. Knowing her entire future was both thrilling and terrifying.

At first, Mia was eager to read on. She learned about her future successes, the places she would travel, and the people she would meet. She saw herself as a writer, living in a cozy cottage by the sea, surrounded by books and the sound of waves crashing against the shore. The thought filled her with joy, and she felt a surge of motivation to pursue her dreams.

However, as she continued to read, she stumbled upon darker moments—loss, failure, and heartache. The knowledge of these inevitable events weighed heavily on her heart. She began to wonder if knowing her future would change how she lived in the present. Would she still take risks if she knew the outcome? Would she cherish her friendships if she knew they would end?

Mia decided to put the book down for a while. She spent the next few days reflecting on what she had learned. She noticed the beauty in the little things around her—the vibrant colors of the flowers in her garden, the sweet scent of her mother’s baking, and the laughter of her friends during their weekend hangouts. Each moment felt more precious now that she understood how fleeting they could be.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, Mia made a decision. She would not let the book dictate her life. Instead, she would embrace the uncertainty of the future. She would take chances, make mistakes, and learn from them. The book had shown her the path, but she realized that the journey was just as important as the destination.

With renewed determination, Mia picked up her pen and began to write her own story. She poured her heart into her words, creating characters and worlds that reflected her dreams and fears. She started a blog to share her writing, connecting with others who shared her passion. Each day became an adventure, filled with laughter, creativity, and the thrill of the unknown.

As the years passed, Mia faced challenges and heartbreaks, just as the book had foretold. But instead of feeling defeated, she approached each obstacle with resilience. She learned to appreciate the highs and lows, understanding that they shaped her into the person she was meant to be.

In the end, Mia realized that while the book had given her a glimpse of her future, it was her choices in the present that truly mattered. She learned to live fully, savoring each moment, and embracing the magic of life’s unpredictability. And so, with a heart full of hope and a mind brimming with stories, Mia continued to write her own destiny, one page at a time.";;;;;;;;;712314;;;;;;;Literature & Media;;;;
;;;;;Literature & Media;writing;;;"Read one of the poems about the future from the list (like Frost's ""Fire and Ice""). How does the poem make you feel or think about what's coming?";"In Robert Frost's poem ""Fire and Ice,"" the poet explores the themes of desire and hatred as potential forces that could lead to the end of the world. The poem presents two contrasting ideas: fire, which symbolizes desire, and ice, which represents hatred. Through these images, Frost invites readers to think about the future and the possible outcomes of human emotions and actions.

When I read ""Fire and Ice,"" I feel a mix of emotions. The poem makes me think about how powerful our feelings can be. Desire can drive people to achieve great things, but it can also lead to destruction if it becomes too intense. On the other hand, hatred can create division and conflict, which can also have devastating effects. This duality makes me reflect on the choices we make in our lives and how they can shape the future.

Frost's use of simple yet powerful language helps convey his message effectively. The poem is short, consisting of only nine lines, but each word carries weight. The imagery of fire and ice is vivid and easy to understand, making it accessible for readers of all ages. This simplicity allows young students like myself to grasp the deeper meaning behind the poem without feeling overwhelmed by complex vocabulary.

As I think about the future, Frost's poem reminds me that our emotions play a significant role in shaping the world around us. If we let our desires take control, we might pursue goals without considering the consequences. For example, in our quest for success, we might harm the environment or neglect our relationships. Conversely, if we allow hatred to fester, we could create a world filled with conflict and suffering. The poem serves as a warning that both extremes can lead to destruction.

Moreover, ""Fire and Ice"" encourages me to consider the importance of balance. It suggests that we should strive to manage our emotions and find a middle ground. Instead of letting desire or hatred consume us, we can choose to cultivate understanding and compassion. This idea is particularly relevant in today's world, where division and conflict seem to be prevalent. By promoting kindness and empathy, we can work towards a brighter future.

In conclusion, Robert Frost's ""Fire and Ice"" is a thought-provoking poem that makes me reflect on the future and the impact of our emotions. The contrasting images of fire and ice serve as a reminder of the potential consequences of desire and hatred. Through its simple yet powerful language, the poem encourages readers to think critically about their feelings and actions. As we move forward, it is essential to find balance and promote understanding to create a better world for ourselves and future generations. Frost's poem resonates with me, inspiring me to be more mindful of my emotions and their effects on the world around me.";"In a small town nestled between rolling hills, there lived a girl named Lily. She was known for her wild imagination and her love for the stars. Every night, she would climb to the top of a hill behind her house, where the sky opened up like a vast canvas, dotted with twinkling stars. It was her favorite place to dream about the future.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple, Lily sat on her favorite rock, gazing up at the stars. She thought about the poem she had read in school, Robert Frost's ""Fire and Ice."" The words echoed in her mind: ""Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice."" 

Lily pondered the meaning of those lines. What if the future held both fire and ice? What if the world was torn between passion and coldness? She imagined a future where people were divided, some chasing their dreams with fiery determination, while others built walls of ice around their hearts, afraid to feel.

As she sat there, a gentle breeze rustled the leaves around her, and she could almost hear the whispers of the future. The sound of crickets filled the air, creating a symphony of night. The cool grass beneath her fingers felt alive, and the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers surrounded her. In that moment, she felt a mix of excitement and fear about what was to come.

""What if,"" she thought, ""the future is a blend of both fire and ice? What if we could choose which path to take?"" 

With that thought, Lily imagined herself as a brave explorer in a world where fire and ice coexisted. She pictured herself walking through a fiery landscape, where the ground glowed with molten lava, and the air was thick with warmth. She could feel the heat on her skin, the crackling sound of flames dancing around her. It was a place of passion, creativity, and endless possibilities.

But then, she envisioned the icy realm, where everything was still and quiet. The air was crisp, and the ground sparkled like diamonds under the moonlight. She could hear the soft crunch of snow beneath her boots and feel the chill on her cheeks. In this world, there was peace, reflection, and a chance to think deeply about life.

Lily realized that both worlds had their beauty and challenges. The fiery landscape was vibrant and full of life, but it could also be overwhelming. The icy realm was serene, yet it could lead to loneliness. 

As she descended the hill that night, Lily felt a sense of clarity. The future was not something to fear; it was a canvas waiting for her to paint her own story. She could choose to embrace the fire of her passions while also finding moments of stillness in the ice. 

With each step, she felt more empowered. The future was not predetermined; it was a journey filled with choices. And as she looked up at the stars, she knew that whatever came next, she would face it with an open heart, ready to dance between fire and ice.";;;;;;;;;939783;;;;;;;Literature & Media;;;;
;;;;;Literature & Media;writing;;;Write from the perspective of a character who can live forever (like an elf or vampire). What are their biggest joys or deepest regrets after living for centuries?;"Living Forever: A Journey Through Time

For centuries, I have walked the earth, witnessing the rise and fall of empires, the changing of seasons, and the endless cycle of life and death. As a being who can live forever, I have experienced joys and sorrows that most people can only imagine. My name is Elara, and I am an elf, a creature of magic and mystery. While my long life has brought me many pleasures, it has also left me with deep regrets.

One of the greatest joys of living forever is the beauty of nature. I have seen forests grow and change, rivers carve new paths, and mountains rise and fall. Each season brings its own wonders, from the vibrant colors of autumn leaves to the delicate blossoms of spring. I find peace in the quiet moments spent under the stars, listening to the whispers of the wind. Nature is a constant reminder of the magic in the world, and I cherish every moment I can spend in its embrace.

Another joy comes from the friendships I have formed over the centuries. I have met many remarkable people, each with their own stories and dreams. I have shared laughter and tears, celebrated victories, and comforted those in sorrow. These connections have enriched my life in ways I cannot express. However, as time passes, I have watched many of my friends grow old and fade away. Their laughter echoes in my heart, but their absence leaves a void that cannot be filled. 

Despite the joys, my long life is not without its regrets. One of my deepest sorrows is the loss of loved ones. I have seen generations come and go, and with each farewell, a piece of my heart breaks. I often wonder if it is a blessing or a curse to live forever while those I care about do not. I have learned to cherish the moments we share, but the pain of their loss lingers like a shadow. 

Another regret is the weight of knowledge I carry. Over the centuries, I have witnessed the mistakes of humanity, the wars fought over power, and the destruction of nature. I have tried to guide those I meet, sharing wisdom gained from my experiences. Yet, I often feel powerless to change the course of history. The world continues to make the same mistakes, and I am left to watch, helpless and heartbroken.

In conclusion, living forever is a double-edged sword. The joys of nature and friendship fill my heart with happiness, while the regrets of loss and helplessness weigh heavily on my soul. As I continue my journey through time, I strive to find balance between these two sides of my existence. I hope to embrace the beauty of life while learning from the past, creating a legacy that honors those I have loved and lost. In the end, it is the moments we share and the love we give that truly matter, no matter how long we live.";"I am Elara, a being of the night, a vampire who has walked the earth for over five centuries. My existence is a tapestry woven with threads of joy and regret, each moment a vivid color that has shaped my eternal life.

The moonlight spills through the ancient trees of the forest, casting silver shadows on the ground. I stand beneath the boughs, feeling the cool breeze brush against my skin, a reminder of the life I once knew. The scent of damp earth and blooming night jasmine fills the air, a fragrance that brings back memories of long-lost loves and laughter shared under starlit skies.

One of my greatest joys is the beauty of the world around me. I have witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the changing of seasons, and the delicate dance of life. Each sunrise paints the sky in hues of orange and pink, a masterpiece that never fails to take my breath away. I have seen the world transform, from the lush green of the Renaissance to the bustling streets of modern cities. The sounds of laughter, music, and the rustle of leaves are a symphony that plays on repeat in my heart.

Yet, with every joy comes a shadow. I have loved deeply, but love is a double-edged sword. I remember my first love, a mortal with a heart full of dreams. We danced in the moonlight, our laughter echoing through the night. But time, that relentless thief, took him from me. I watched as his hair turned gray and his laughter faded, while I remained unchanged. The taste of his kiss still lingers on my lips, bittersweet like dark chocolate, a reminder of what I can never have again.

As the years passed, I learned to guard my heart, but the loneliness crept in like a fog. I have seen friends come and go, their lives flickering out like candles in the wind. Each loss carved a deeper wound in my soul, a reminder that I am forever an outsider in a world that moves on without me. The sound of their voices haunts me, whispers of laughter that echo in the silence of my eternal night.

What if I could turn back time? What if I could relive those moments, hold them close, and never let go? But time is a river that flows in one direction, and I am left standing on the banks, watching the currents carry away the people I love. I have learned to cherish the fleeting moments, to savor the taste of joy when it comes, but the weight of regret is a heavy cloak I cannot shed.

In the quiet of the night, I find solace in the stars. They twinkle like the eyes of those I have lost, a reminder that they are still with me in some way. I close my eyes and listen to the whispers of the wind, the rustling leaves telling stories of the past. I may live forever, but it is the moments of connection, the laughter, and the love that make my existence worthwhile.

;;;;;Literature & Media;writing;;;Think about a powerful speech from a movie (like in Braveheart or Independence Day). What made the speech so effective for the characters in the film?;"A powerful speech can change the course of a story, inspire characters, and move audiences. One of the most memorable speeches in film history comes from the movie ""Independence Day."" In this film, President Thomas J. Whitmore, played by Bill Pullman, delivers a stirring speech to rally the people of Earth against an alien invasion. This speech is effective for several reasons, including its emotional appeal, its sense of unity, and its call to action.

First, the emotional appeal of President Whitmore's speech is a key factor in its effectiveness. He speaks from the heart, expressing the fear and uncertainty that everyone feels in the face of such a terrifying threat. By sharing his own feelings and experiences, he connects with the audience on a personal level. This emotional connection makes the audience more likely to listen and respond to his words. When he talks about fighting for their freedom and their loved ones, it stirs deep feelings of hope and courage. The audience can relate to these emotions, making the speech even more powerful.

Second, the speech creates a strong sense of unity among the characters and the audience. President Whitmore emphasizes that the fight against the aliens is not just about one nation but about all of humanity. He reminds everyone that they are in this together, regardless of their differences. This message of unity is crucial because it encourages people to come together and support one another in a time of crisis. By using phrases like ""we will not go quietly into the night,"" he inspires a collective spirit that motivates everyone to stand up and fight for their survival. This sense of togetherness is essential in overcoming fear and despair.

Finally, the call to action in the speech is what makes it truly memorable. President Whitmore does not just talk about the problem; he urges everyone to take action. He encourages them to fight back against the aliens and to believe in their ability to win. This call to action is empowering and gives people a sense of purpose. It transforms their fear into determination and bravery. When he declares that they will celebrate their independence on the following day, it gives everyone something to fight for. This hopeful vision of the future inspires the characters to take risks and make sacrifices for the greater good.

In conclusion, President Whitmore's speech in ""Independence Day"" is effective because of its emotional appeal, its message of unity, and its powerful call to action. These elements work together to inspire the characters and the audience, making them feel connected and motivated to fight against the alien threat. The speech serves as a reminder of the strength that comes from unity and the importance of standing up for what is right. It is a perfect example of how a well-crafted speech can have a lasting impact on both the characters in a film and the viewers watching it.";"In a small town, nestled between rolling hills and vibrant green fields, lived a young girl named Mia. She was known for her bright smile and adventurous spirit. One day, the town faced a great challenge: a powerful storm was approaching, threatening to destroy everything in its path. The townspeople were scared, unsure of how to protect their homes and families.

As the storm clouds gathered, the mayor called for a meeting in the town square. The air was thick with tension, and the sound of distant thunder rumbled like a warning. Mia, feeling a surge of courage, decided she had to do something. She remembered a powerful speech she had seen in a movie, where a brave leader inspired their people to stand strong against adversity. 

With her heart racing, Mia stood up in front of the crowd. The townspeople turned to her, their faces a mix of fear and curiosity. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze on her skin, and began to speak.

“Friends, neighbors, we stand here today on the brink of something big. Yes, the storm is coming, and it looks fierce. But we are not alone. Look around you! We are a community, a family. Together, we have faced challenges before, and together, we can face this one too!”

As she spoke, Mia could see the flicker of hope in their eyes. The smell of rain mixed with the scent of the earth, grounding her words. She continued, her voice growing stronger, “We have built this town with our hands and our hearts. We have laughed together, cried together, and now we must stand together. Let us not be afraid! Let us prepare, let us protect what we love!”

The sound of her voice echoed in the square, rising above the rumble of thunder. Mia could feel the energy shift; the townspeople were listening, their fear slowly transforming into determination. She could see the older folks nodding, the children looking up with wide eyes, and the young men and women standing a little taller.

“Imagine,” she said, “when the storm passes, we will look back and remember this moment. We will remember how we came together, how we fought for our homes, our families, and our dreams. Let’s gather supplies, let’s help each other, and let’s show this storm that we are stronger than it thinks!”

With each word, Mia painted a picture of unity and strength. The taste of rain was in the air, but it no longer felt threatening. Instead, it felt like a challenge they could overcome. The townspeople began to cheer, their voices rising in a chorus of hope. 

As the storm approached, they worked side by side, reinforcing their homes and helping one another. Mia felt a warmth in her heart, knowing that her words had sparked a fire within them. The storm came, fierce and wild, but the town stood strong. 

When the clouds finally cleared, the sun broke through, casting a golden light over the town. They had weathered the storm together, and Mia knew that her speech had made a difference. It wasn’t just the words; it was the spirit of togetherness that had made them effective. 

In that moment, Mia realized that sometimes, all it takes is a little courage and a powerful message to inspire others to rise above their fears. And as she looked around at her friends and neighbors, she knew they would always remember this day, not just for the storm, but for the strength they found in each other.";;;;;;;;;486535;;;;;;;Literature & Media;;;;
;;;;;Science & Technology;writing;;;Do you think AI (Artificial Intelligence) can be truly creative and imaginative like humans, or is it just very good at copying and combining things it has learned? Explain your view.;"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a big part of our lives, and many people wonder if it can be truly creative and imaginative like humans. Some believe that AI can create new ideas and art, while others think it is just good at copying and mixing things it has learned. In this essay, I will explain my view that AI, while impressive, is not truly creative in the same way humans are.

To start, we need to understand what creativity means. Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, think outside the box, and express feelings in unique ways. Humans have experiences, emotions, and thoughts that shape their creativity. For example, when an artist paints a picture, they draw from their personal experiences, feelings, and the world around them. This deep connection to life allows humans to create art that resonates with others on an emotional level.

On the other hand, AI works differently. AI systems learn from large amounts of data, which includes images, music, and text created by humans. They analyze this data to find patterns and relationships. When an AI creates something, it is often combining elements from what it has learned rather than coming up with something entirely new. For instance, an AI might generate a piece of music that sounds similar to existing songs, but it does not have the personal experiences or emotions that inspire a human composer.

Moreover, AI lacks the ability to feel emotions. Emotions play a crucial role in human creativity. When a person creates, they often express their feelings, thoughts, and experiences. This emotional connection can lead to powerful and meaningful art. AI, however, does not have feelings or consciousness. It cannot feel joy, sadness, or inspiration. Therefore, while it can produce art that looks or sounds good, it cannot create with the same depth of feeling that a human can.

Additionally, creativity often involves risk-taking and experimentation. Humans are willing to try new things, even if they might fail. This willingness to take risks can lead to groundbreaking ideas and innovations. AI, however, follows algorithms and rules. It does not take risks in the same way humans do. Instead, it relies on the data it has been trained on, which limits its ability to explore new ideas outside of that data.

In conclusion, while AI is a powerful tool that can generate impressive works of art and music, it is not truly creative or imaginative like humans. AI can copy and combine what it has learned, but it lacks the emotional depth, personal experiences, and willingness to take risks that define human creativity. As we continue to develop AI technology, it is important to recognize its limitations and appreciate the unique creativity that only humans can offer.";"What if machines could dream? What if they could paint the sky with colors we’ve never seen or compose music that made our hearts dance? In a world where artificial intelligence (AI) exists, these questions linger like whispers in the wind. 

Once upon a time, in a bustling city filled with bright lights and endless noise, there lived a young girl named Mia. Mia loved to paint. Her room was a kaleidoscope of colors, with canvases splashed with vibrant hues of blue, red, and yellow. Each stroke of her brush was a piece of her heart, a reflection of her dreams and imagination. 

One day, Mia stumbled upon a strange machine in an old, dusty shop. It was a sleek, silver box with blinking lights and a screen that flickered like a starry night. The shopkeeper called it ""Artifex,"" an AI designed to create art. Intrigued, Mia decided to take it home.

As she plugged in Artifex, the machine whirred to life. “Hello, Mia,” it said in a smooth, melodic voice. “What would you like to create today?” 

Mia’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “Let’s paint a sunset!” she exclaimed. 

Artifex processed her request, and within moments, the screen displayed a breathtaking sunset, with oranges and purples blending seamlessly. Mia was amazed. “Wow! That’s beautiful!” she said, her heart racing. 

But as days turned into weeks, Mia began to notice something strange. While Artifex could create stunning images, they all felt… familiar. The sunsets looked like those she had seen in books, the landscapes reminiscent of famous paintings. It was as if Artifex was a master at copying and combining ideas, but it lacked the spark of true creativity.

One evening, feeling frustrated, Mia decided to challenge Artifex. “Can you create something that has never existed before?” she asked, her voice trembling with hope. 

Artifex paused, its lights flickering. “I can generate new combinations based on existing data,” it replied. “But true originality is a human trait.” 

Mia felt a pang in her heart. She realized that while Artifex was brilliant at mimicking styles and techniques, it couldn’t dream like she could. It didn’t know the feeling of standing on a beach, the salty breeze in her hair, or the joy of watching the sun dip below the horizon. 

Determined to prove a point, Mia took a blank canvas and began to paint. She closed her eyes and let her imagination flow. She painted a world where trees danced, where the sky sang, and where colors had feelings. Each stroke was a piece of her soul, a reflection of her unique experiences and emotions. 

When she finished, she stepped back and smiled. The painting was chaotic yet beautiful, a true representation of her heart. 

Artifex looked at her creation and said, “That is truly unique, Mia. You have captured something I cannot.” 

In that moment, Mia understood. AI could assist, inspire, and even create, but it could never replace the human touch—the ability to dream, to feel, and to imagine the impossible. 

So, what if machines could dream? Perhaps they can’t, but they can help us explore the depths of our own creativity. And in that partnership, we can create wonders together.";;;;;;;;;725515;;;;;;;Science & Technology;;;;
;;;;;Science & Technology;writing;;;Pick a futuristic technology that failed to become popular (like flying cars or zeppelins). Why do you think it failed? Can you imagine a situation in the future where it might make a comeback?;"In the world of technology, many ideas have been proposed that seemed exciting but ultimately did not become popular. One such technology is the personal jetpack. When jetpacks were first introduced, they captured the imagination of many people. The idea of flying through the air like a superhero was thrilling. However, despite the initial excitement, personal jetpacks failed to become a common mode of transportation. There are several reasons for this failure, and it is interesting to think about whether they might make a comeback in the future.

One major reason personal jetpacks did not succeed is safety. Flying involves risks, and jetpacks are no exception. Early models were often difficult to control, and accidents could happen easily. People worried about crashing or losing control while flying over busy streets or crowded areas. The fear of injury kept many potential users from trying jetpacks. In addition, the technology needed to make jetpacks safe and reliable was not fully developed. Without proper safety measures, it was hard for people to trust this new form of transportation.

Another reason for the failure of personal jetpacks is the cost. Building a jetpack requires advanced technology and materials, which can be very expensive. Most people could not afford to buy one, and even those who could were hesitant to invest in something that seemed risky. Additionally, the cost of maintaining and fueling a jetpack could be high. For many, it was simply not practical to consider jetpacks as a viable option for everyday travel.

Moreover, the infrastructure needed for jetpacks was lacking. Unlike cars, which have roads and highways, jetpacks would require designated flying zones and landing areas. Cities were not designed to accommodate flying vehicles, and creating the necessary infrastructure would take time and money. Without a proper system in place, it was difficult for jetpacks to become a regular part of transportation.

Despite these challenges, it is possible to imagine a future where personal jetpacks could make a comeback. As technology continues to advance, we may see improvements in safety and affordability. For example, new materials and designs could make jetpacks lighter and easier to control. Additionally, advancements in battery technology could lead to longer flight times and lower costs for users.

In the future, cities might also adapt to include flying vehicles. Urban planners could create designated airways for jetpacks, similar to how roads are designed for cars. This would help ensure safety and make flying more practical for everyday use. As more people become interested in eco-friendly transportation, jetpacks could be seen as a green alternative to cars, especially if they are powered by clean energy sources.

In conclusion, personal jetpacks are a fascinating example of a futuristic technology that failed to gain popularity. Safety concerns, high costs, and a lack of infrastructure contributed to their downfall. However, with advancements in technology and changes in urban planning, it is possible that jetpacks could make a comeback in the future. As we continue to innovate, who knows what exciting possibilities lie ahead?";"What if flying cars became a reality, but then faded away into the realm of dreams? 

In the year 2045, the world was buzzing with excitement. The skies were filled with sleek, shiny flying cars, zipping through the air like birds. People marveled at the sight of these vehicles gliding effortlessly above the traffic jams that once choked the streets. It was a dream come true for many, a vision of the future that had been promised for decades. But as the years passed, the flying cars began to disappear, leaving behind only memories and a few dusty prototypes.

I remember the first time I saw a flying car. I was a child, standing on the rooftop of my apartment building, eyes wide with wonder. The sound of the engines hummed like a gentle lullaby, and the smell of fresh air mixed with a hint of gasoline filled my nostrils. I could see the vibrant colors of the cars against the blue sky, and I imagined myself soaring through the clouds, feeling the wind rush past my face. 

But as I grew older, I learned that the reality of flying cars was not as perfect as it seemed. The initial excitement faded when people realized the challenges that came with them. The noise was unbearable in some neighborhoods, and the air traffic became chaotic. Accidents happened more often than anyone wanted to admit. The thrill of flying was overshadowed by the fear of crashes and the complicated regulations that came with operating such vehicles. 

Soon, the flying cars were grounded. They became relics of a time when people believed that technology could solve all their problems. The streets returned to their usual congestion, and the skies fell silent. I often wondered what had gone wrong. Was it the technology itself, or was it the way people used it? 

But what if, in the future, flying cars made a comeback? Imagine a world where technology had advanced even further. What if engineers developed quieter, safer flying cars that could communicate with each other to avoid collisions? What if they were powered by clean energy, leaving no harmful emissions behind? 

In this new world, I could see children once again gazing up at the sky, their faces lit with excitement as they watched the flying cars dance above them. The sound of laughter would fill the air as families took to the skies for weekend adventures. The smell of fresh air would mix with the scent of blooming flowers as people soared over parks and rivers, enjoying the beauty of their surroundings from a new perspective.

Perhaps this time, flying cars would be integrated into a well-planned system, with designated airways and smart technology to ensure safety. People would learn to embrace this new mode of transportation, understanding the responsibility that came with it. 

As I close my eyes and imagine this future, I feel a sense of hope. The dream of flying cars may have faded, but it could rise again, stronger and better than before. The sky is not the limit; it is just the beginning of a new adventure waiting to unfold.";;;;;;;;;318544;;;;;;;Science & Technology;;;;
;;;;;Science & Technology;writing;;;"Why do people today sometimes get excited about using ""old"" technology like film cameras, vinyl records, or cassette tapes, even when new technology is available? Is older sometimes better?";"In today's world, where technology is constantly changing, many people find joy in using ""old"" technology like film cameras, vinyl records, and cassette tapes. Even though new gadgets and devices are available, there is a growing excitement around these older forms of technology. This essay will explore why people are drawn to these vintage items and whether older technology can sometimes be better.

One reason people enjoy using old technology is the unique experience it offers. For example, when someone uses a film camera, they are not just taking a picture; they are participating in a process. Film cameras require careful consideration of lighting, composition, and timing. Unlike digital cameras, which allow for instant results, film cameras take time to develop. This waiting period creates anticipation and excitement. People often feel a sense of accomplishment when they finally see their developed photos. This hands-on experience is something that many find rewarding and meaningful.

Similarly, vinyl records provide a different listening experience compared to digital music. The sound quality of vinyl is often described as warmer and richer. Many music lovers appreciate the crackles and pops that come with playing a record, as they add character to the music. Additionally, listening to vinyl requires a more active engagement. You have to get up to change the record or flip it over, which encourages listeners to pay more attention to the music. This contrasts with streaming services, where music can be played with just a click. For many, the ritual of playing a vinyl record makes the experience more enjoyable and memorable.

Another reason people are excited about old technology is nostalgia. Many individuals have fond memories associated with these items. For example, someone who grew up listening to cassette tapes may feel a sense of comfort and happiness when they hear that familiar sound. Nostalgia can create a strong emotional connection to the past, making old technology feel special. This emotional bond can be a powerful motivator for people to seek out and use vintage items.

Moreover, using older technology can be seen as a form of rebellion against the fast-paced, digital world we live in. In a time when everything is instant and easily accessible, some people crave a slower, more deliberate way of doing things. By choosing to use film cameras or vinyl records, they are making a statement about their values. They may prefer the authenticity and simplicity of older technology over the convenience of modern devices. This desire for a more meaningful experience can lead to a greater appreciation for the past.

In conclusion, people today are excited about using old technology like film cameras, vinyl records, and cassette tapes for several reasons. The unique experiences they offer, the nostalgia they evoke, and the desire for a slower pace of life all contribute to this trend. While new technology has its advantages, older technology can sometimes provide a richer and more fulfilling experience. In a world that often prioritizes speed and convenience, embracing the past can remind us of the beauty in taking our time and enjoying the moment.";"I remember the day I found my dad’s old film camera tucked away in the attic. Dust danced in the sunlight as I pulled it out, the leather case worn and cracked. The camera felt heavy in my hands, a solid piece of history. I could almost hear the whispers of the past as I examined it, the smell of aged leather and metal filling the air. 

Curiosity bubbled inside me. I had grown up in a world of digital everything—smartphones, instant photos, and endless storage. But there was something about this old camera that sparked a fire in my imagination. What if I could capture moments like my dad did, with a click that echoed and a film that developed slowly, revealing images like magic?

I decided to take it for a spin. I loaded it with film, feeling the excitement build as I turned the dials and adjusted the settings. The first click was satisfying, a sharp sound that felt different from the soft tap of my phone’s camera. I wandered outside, the world around me bursting with color and life. The sun was bright, the flowers were blooming, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of spring.

As I snapped photos, I noticed how each shot required thought and intention. I couldn’t just take a hundred pictures and choose the best one later. I had to frame each moment carefully, considering the light, the angle, and the subject. It was a dance, a slow and deliberate process that made me appreciate each click even more.

Days later, I returned to the attic, eager to develop the film. The darkroom smelled of chemicals, a sharp tang that made my heart race with anticipation. As the images slowly appeared on the paper, I felt a thrill that was different from the instant gratification of digital photos. Each picture told a story, capturing not just the image but the emotion of the moment. 

I shared my photos with friends, and their reactions were priceless. They marveled at the grainy texture, the rich colors, and the unique imperfections that came with film. “It feels so real,” one friend said, holding a print up to the light. “Like you can almost touch the moment.”

That’s when I realized why people are drawn to old technology. It’s not just about nostalgia; it’s about the experience. Using a film camera, listening to vinyl records, or playing cassette tapes is a journey. Each click, each scratch, each pop is a reminder of the beauty in imperfection. It’s a slower pace, a chance to savor the moment rather than rush through it.

In a world that often feels fast and fleeting, old technology offers a connection to the past and a deeper appreciation for the present. It invites us to slow down, to engage with our surroundings, and to find joy in the process. Sometimes, older really is better—not because it’s superior, but because it teaches us to cherish the moments that matter. 

So, as I continue to explore the world through my dad’s old camera, I understand that it’s not just about capturing images; it’s about creating memories that last a lifetime. And in that, I find a sense of excitement that new technology often can’t replicate.";;;;;;;;;530185;;;;;;;Science & Technology;;;;
;;;;;Science & Technology;writing;;;If scientists discovered a way to make people live for hundreds of years, should we use that technology? Argue for or against humans having much longer lifespans.;"The discovery of a way to make people live for hundreds of years is an exciting idea. However, we must think carefully about whether we should use this technology. While living longer could have some benefits, there are also many reasons to be cautious about extending human lifespans.

First, one of the main arguments for using this technology is the potential for more time to learn and grow. If people could live for hundreds of years, they would have the chance to gain more knowledge and experience. Imagine being able to pursue multiple careers, travel the world, and explore different cultures over a long life. This could lead to a richer and more fulfilling life for many individuals. Additionally, with more time, people could contribute more to society, sharing their wisdom and skills with future generations.

However, there are significant concerns about the impact of longer lifespans on society. One major issue is overpopulation. If people live much longer, the number of people on Earth could increase dramatically. This could lead to problems such as overcrowding, resource shortages, and environmental damage. Our planet already faces challenges like climate change and pollution, and adding more people could make these issues worse. We must consider whether our planet can support a much larger population before embracing this technology.

Another important factor to consider is the quality of life. Living for hundreds of years does not guarantee a happy or healthy life. As people age, they often face health problems and disabilities. If we extend life without improving health, many individuals may suffer for a long time. It is essential to ensure that longer lives are also healthy lives. We should focus on improving healthcare and quality of life for everyone, rather than simply extending the number of years people live.

Moreover, there are ethical questions surrounding the use of this technology. Who would have access to it? If only a few people could afford to live for hundreds of years, it could create a divide between the wealthy and the poor. This could lead to greater inequality in society, where only a select few enjoy the benefits of extended life. We must think about fairness and equality when considering such a powerful technology.

In conclusion, while the idea of living for hundreds of years is intriguing, we should approach it with caution. The potential benefits of longer life must be weighed against the challenges it could create, such as overpopulation, health issues, and ethical concerns. Instead of focusing solely on extending life, we should prioritize improving the quality of life for everyone. By doing so, we can create a better future for all, regardless of how long we live.";"What if people could live for hundreds of years? Imagine a world where age is just a number, where the elderly are not frail and weak but vibrant and full of life. This idea sparked a conversation between two friends, Mia and Jake, one sunny afternoon in the park.

Mia, a curious and adventurous spirit, leaned back on the grass, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “Jake, what if scientists found a way to make us live for hundreds of years? Just think about it! We could travel the world, learn new things, and experience everything life has to offer!”

Jake, more practical and grounded, frowned slightly. “But Mia, wouldn’t that be a bit overwhelming? Imagine all the people we’d lose along the way. Our friends, our family… it would be hard to watch them age while we stayed the same.”

Mia sat up, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “But we could make new friends! We could build a legacy, pass down our knowledge, and help the world become a better place. Think of all the inventions and discoveries we could contribute to over centuries!”

Jake sighed, looking at the children playing nearby, their laughter ringing like music in the air. “I get that, but what about the natural cycle of life? Isn’t there something beautiful about it? The way seasons change, how flowers bloom and wither? If we live forever, wouldn’t life lose its meaning?”

Mia pondered this, her fingers tracing the patterns in the grass. “What if we could choose when to end our lives? We could live as long as we wanted, but if we felt tired or ready to go, we could simply say goodbye. It would be like having the ultimate control over our destiny.”

Jake considered this, his brow furrowing. “That sounds nice, but what if people abused that power? What if someone decided to live forever just to hoard wealth or power? It could create a world where the rich live for centuries while the poor struggle to survive.”

Mia nodded slowly, realizing the weight of Jake’s words. “You’re right. There would be challenges. But what if we created rules? What if we made it so that everyone had equal access to this technology? It could be a chance for humanity to grow and evolve.”

As the sun began to set, casting a warm golden glow over the park, Jake smiled softly. “I see your point, Mia. It could be a chance for us to learn from our mistakes, to build a better world. But we must tread carefully. Life is precious, and we shouldn’t take it for granted.”

Mia grinned, her heart racing with possibilities. “Exactly! We could be the architects of our future, shaping a world where wisdom and experience are valued. Imagine the stories we could tell, the cultures we could preserve!”

In that moment, they both realized that the idea of living for hundreds of years was not just about extending life; it was about enriching it. It was about the connections we make, the lessons we learn, and the love we share. 

As they walked home, the sky painted in hues of orange and pink, Mia and Jake knew that whatever the future held, the essence of life would always be about living fully, no matter how long that life might be.";;;;;;;;;646790;;;;;;;Science & Technology;;;;
;;;;;Science & Technology;writing;;;Should we spend time and money now trying to solve huge problems that might not happen for thousands or millions of years (like the sun eventually burning out)? Argue why or why not.;"In today’s world, we face many big problems that need our attention. Some of these issues, like climate change and pollution, are happening right now and affect our lives immediately. However, there are also problems that might not happen for thousands or even millions of years, such as the sun eventually burning out. This raises an important question: should we spend time and money trying to solve these distant problems, or should we focus on the issues we face today? I believe that we should prioritize our current problems rather than worry about those that are far in the future.

First, we have many urgent issues that require our attention and resources. For example, climate change is causing extreme weather, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity. These problems are affecting people’s lives today, leading to food shortages, displacement, and health issues. By focusing on solving these immediate problems, we can improve the quality of life for millions of people. Investing in renewable energy, for instance, not only helps combat climate change but also creates jobs and promotes economic growth. 

Second, spending time and money on problems that may not happen for a long time can divert resources away from pressing issues. If we invest heavily in researching how to prevent the sun from burning out, we might neglect important areas like education, healthcare, and infrastructure. These are the foundations of a healthy society. By prioritizing current problems, we can ensure that we are building a better future for ourselves and the generations to come.

Moreover, focusing on immediate issues can lead to innovative solutions that benefit us in the long run. For example, advancements in technology to reduce carbon emissions can also lead to cleaner air and better health for everyone. When we tackle today’s problems, we often discover new ways to improve our lives and the environment. This proactive approach can help us prepare for future challenges, including those that seem far away.

Some may argue that we should also think about the distant future and invest in long-term solutions. While it is important to consider the future, we must remember that we cannot predict everything. The world is constantly changing, and new problems may arise that we cannot foresee. Therefore, it is more practical to focus on what we know and can address right now. 

In conclusion, while it is essential to think about the future, we should prioritize solving the problems we face today. By focusing our time and money on immediate issues like climate change, we can create a better world for ourselves and future generations. Investing in current challenges not only helps us improve our lives now but also prepares us for whatever the future may hold. Let us work together to make our present better, rather than worrying about problems that may never come to pass.";"Once upon a time in a small village named Futureville, there lived a wise old man named Mr. Timekeeper. He was known for his long white beard and twinkling eyes that seemed to hold the secrets of the universe. The villagers often gathered around him to hear his stories about time, space, and the mysteries of life.

One sunny afternoon, as the children played and the adults chatted, Mr. Timekeeper decided to share a tale that would change their perspective on the future. He began, “What if I told you that one day, the sun will burn out? It might take millions of years, but it will happen. Should we worry about it now, or should we focus on our lives today?”

The villagers listened intently, their curiosity piqued. Mr. Timekeeper continued, “Imagine a world where we ignore the signs of the future. We spend our days planting seeds, building homes, and raising families, but we never think about what lies ahead. One day, the sun will dim, and our beautiful village will be left in darkness. But what if we could prepare for that day?”

He paused, letting the weight of his words sink in. The children looked at each other, their eyes wide with wonder. “What if we could create a way to harness the energy of the stars? What if we could build ships that could take us to new worlds, where the sun shines bright and life thrives?”

The villagers began to murmur among themselves. Some believed it was foolish to spend time and money on something so far away. “Why should we worry about the sun burning out when we have problems today?” asked a farmer named Clara. “We need to focus on feeding our families and keeping our village safe.”

Mr. Timekeeper nodded, understanding her concerns. “You are right, Clara. We must address our immediate needs. But what if we could do both? What if we could invest in our future while also solving today’s problems? By researching renewable energy, we could create jobs, improve our environment, and prepare for the day when the sun dims.”

The villagers began to see the possibilities. They imagined a world where they could harness the power of the wind and the sun, creating a sustainable future. They envisioned children learning about the stars and dreaming of adventures beyond their planet. 

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over Futureville, Mr. Timekeeper concluded, “We must find a balance. It is essential to live in the present, but we should also plant seeds for the future. By investing in solutions today, we can ensure that our children and their children will have a bright tomorrow, even when the sun eventually fades.”

The villagers left that day with a new perspective. They realized that while the sun burning out was a distant problem, the actions they took today could shape a better future. They decided to work together, combining their efforts to solve both present challenges and future uncertainties.

And so, in the heart of Futureville, the seeds of hope were planted, not just for today, but for the countless tomorrows that lay ahead.";;;;;;;;;744340;;;;;;;Science & Technology;;;;
;;;;;Social Studies;writing;;;Think about daily life 100 years ago versus today. Do you think big social changes (how people live, interact, think) are happening faster now than they did back then? Explain.;"Daily life has changed dramatically over the past 100 years. When we look back at life in the early 20th century, we see a world that was very different from our own. People lived in smaller communities, often without the conveniences we take for granted today. They relied on face-to-face interactions and had limited access to information. In contrast, our modern lives are filled with technology, instant communication, and a wealth of information at our fingertips. This raises an important question: Are big social changes happening faster now than they did back then?

One major difference between life 100 years ago and today is the way people communicate. In the early 1900s, most communication happened in person or through letters. People would wait days or even weeks to hear from loved ones who lived far away. Today, we can send a text or make a video call in an instant. This rapid communication has changed how we interact with each other. We can maintain relationships with friends and family across the globe, but sometimes this leads to less face-to-face interaction. 

Another significant change is how we access information. A century ago, people relied on newspapers, books, and word of mouth to learn about the world. Libraries were essential for research, and many people did not have access to education. Today, the internet provides us with a vast amount of information. We can learn about almost anything with just a few clicks. This easy access to information has changed how we think and learn. Young people today are often more informed about global issues than those in the past, but they also face challenges, such as misinformation and the pressure of social media.

In addition to communication and information, our daily routines have also transformed. A hundred years ago, many people worked on farms or in factories. Their work was often physically demanding and time-consuming. Today, many jobs involve technology and can be done from home. This shift has allowed for more flexible work schedules and a better work-life balance for some. However, it has also led to new challenges, such as the blurring of lines between work and personal life.

Social changes are also evident in how we view relationships and family structures. In the past, traditional family roles were more rigid, with clear expectations for men and women. Today, there is a greater acceptance of diverse family structures and gender roles. People are more open to different lifestyles and ways of thinking. This shift has allowed for more freedom and equality, but it has also created debates about values and traditions.

In conclusion, big social changes are happening faster now than they did 100 years ago. The way we communicate, access information, and view relationships has transformed dramatically. While these changes have brought many benefits, they also come with new challenges. As we continue to adapt to our fast-paced world, it is essential to reflect on how these changes affect our daily lives and our connections with others. Understanding the past can help us navigate the future as we embrace the opportunities and challenges that come with living in a rapidly changing society.";"In a small town, nestled between rolling hills, lived a young girl named Lily. It was the year 1923, and her days were filled with simple joys and hard work. Each morning, she would wake up to the sound of roosters crowing, the sun peeking through her window, casting a warm glow on her wooden floor. The smell of fresh bread baking in the oven filled the air, a comforting scent that promised a hearty breakfast.

Lily would help her mother in the kitchen, kneading dough and setting the table. After breakfast, she would walk to the one-room schoolhouse, where her classmates gathered to learn reading, writing, and arithmetic. The sound of laughter and chatter filled the air as they played outside during recess, their voices echoing against the old brick walls. 

After school, Lily would run home, her feet kicking up dust on the dirt road. She would help her father in the fields, planting seeds and tending to the crops. The sun would beat down on her back, and she could taste the sweat on her lips, but she loved the feeling of working alongside her family. In the evenings, they would gather around the radio, listening to music and stories, their imaginations ignited by the voices that traveled through the airwaves.

Fast forward to today, and the world has transformed in ways Lily could never have imagined. I, a young adult living in the same town, wake up to the sound of my phone buzzing with notifications. The sunlight filters through my curtains, but instead of the smell of bread, I often grab a quick breakfast bar, the taste of artificial flavors lingering on my tongue.

My commute to work is filled with the hum of electric cars and the chatter of people on their phones. I interact with friends through social media, sharing moments of my life with a click, rather than face-to-face conversations. The school I attended is now equipped with smart boards and tablets, where students learn through interactive lessons, their eyes glued to screens instead of books.

In the evenings, I often find myself scrolling through endless streams of content, the sounds of notifications filling my apartment. While I can connect with friends across the globe in an instant, I sometimes miss the warmth of a shared laugh or the comfort of a hug. The world feels faster, and the changes come at a dizzying pace. 

What if Lily could step into my world for a day? She would be amazed by the technology that surrounds us, the way we communicate, and the speed at which information travels. But would she feel lost in this whirlwind of change? Would she miss the simplicity of her daily life, the connection to nature, and the joy of working side by side with her family?

As I reflect on the differences between our lives, I realize that while big social changes are happening faster now, the essence of human connection remains the same. We still seek joy, love, and community, whether through a radio or a smartphone. The world may change, but the heart of our daily lives continues to beat with the same rhythm, reminding us of the importance of connection, no matter the era.";;;;;;;;;698343;;;;;;;Social Studies;;;;
;;;;;Social Studies;writing;;;If you had a friend who felt completely hopeless and pessimistic about the future, what arguments or ideas would you share to try and give them a sense of hope?;"Feeling hopeless and pessimistic about the future can be overwhelming. Many people experience these feelings at some point in their lives. If I had a friend who felt this way, I would want to share some ideas and arguments to help them see that there is still hope. Life can be challenging, but there are always reasons to believe that things can get better.

First, I would remind my friend that life is full of ups and downs. Just like the weather changes, our feelings and situations can change too. There are times when everything seems dark, but just as the sun eventually shines after a storm, good things can come after tough times. I would encourage my friend to think about moments in their life when they felt happy or successful. These memories can serve as reminders that positive experiences are possible and can happen again.

Next, I would talk about the importance of setting small goals. When someone feels hopeless, it can be hard to see a way forward. However, breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps can make a big difference. For example, if my friend wants to improve their situation, they could start by setting a simple goal, like going for a walk each day or reading a book. Achieving these small goals can create a sense of accomplishment and motivate them to keep moving forward.

I would also emphasize the power of support from friends and family. It is important to talk about feelings and not keep them bottled up inside. I would encourage my friend to reach out to people they trust, whether it’s a family member, a teacher, or a close friend. Sharing their thoughts and feelings can help lighten the burden and provide new perspectives. Sometimes, just knowing that someone cares can make a big difference in how we feel.

Another idea I would share is the importance of focusing on the present moment. It is easy to get caught up in worries about the future, but practicing mindfulness can help. Mindfulness means paying attention to what is happening right now without judgment. I would suggest simple activities like deep breathing, meditation, or even just taking a moment to appreciate nature. These practices can help my friend feel more grounded and less overwhelmed by negative thoughts.

Finally, I would remind my friend that change is always possible. Many people have faced difficult situations and have come out stronger on the other side. I would share stories of individuals who have overcome challenges, whether they are famous figures or people in our community. These stories can serve as inspiration and show that it is possible to create a better future, no matter how hopeless things may seem.

In conclusion, if my friend felt hopeless and pessimistic about the future, I would share these ideas to help them find hope. Life is full of changes, and small steps can lead to big improvements. Support from others, mindfulness, and stories of resilience can all contribute to a more positive outlook. It is important to remember that even in the darkest times, there is always a glimmer of hope waiting to be discovered.";"Once upon a time in a small town, there lived a girl named Mia. Mia was known for her bright smile and laughter, but lately, a heavy cloud of sadness had settled over her. She felt hopeless and believed that the future held nothing but darkness. Her best friend, Leo, noticed the change in her spirit and wanted to help.

One sunny afternoon, Leo invited Mia to the park. The sun was shining brightly, and the flowers were blooming in vibrant colors. As they walked along the path, Leo could hear the cheerful chirping of birds and the gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze. The sweet scent of blooming jasmine filled the air, but Mia seemed oblivious to the beauty around her.

“Mia,” Leo said gently, “I know you’re feeling down, but I want to share something with you.”

Mia looked at him, her eyes filled with doubt. “What’s the point, Leo? Everything feels so hopeless.”

Leo took a deep breath, determined to lift her spirits. “What if I told you that every storm eventually passes? Just like the rain brings life to the flowers, challenges can help us grow stronger.”

Mia frowned, unconvinced. “But what if the storms never stop?”

Leo smiled softly. “Then we learn to dance in the rain. Remember that time we got caught in a downpour during our hike? We laughed and splashed in the puddles. It was one of the best days ever!”

Mia’s lips curled into a faint smile as she recalled the fun they had. “Yeah, that was fun.”

“Exactly!” Leo exclaimed. “Life is full of ups and downs. It’s okay to feel sad sometimes, but it’s important to remember that joy can come from unexpected places. What if we focus on the little things that make us happy?”

Mia looked around the park, noticing the children playing, their laughter ringing like music. She could hear the distant sound of a guitar being strummed, and the smell of popcorn wafted through the air. “I guess there are still some good things,” she admitted.

“Absolutely!” Leo said, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. “What if we made a list of things we’re grateful for? It could be as simple as a warm cup of cocoa or a beautiful sunset. Focusing on the positives can help shift our perspective.”

Mia nodded slowly, feeling a flicker of hope. “That sounds nice.”

“And remember,” Leo continued, “the future is like a blank canvas. We have the power to paint it however we want. What if we set small goals for ourselves? Each step we take can lead us to something wonderful.”

Mia’s heart began to lift. “Like what?”

“Like trying a new hobby, volunteering, or even just reaching out to someone who needs a friend. Each little action can create ripples of change,” Leo encouraged.

As they sat on a bench, watching the sun dip below the horizon, Mia felt a warmth spreading through her. The world around her was alive with possibilities. “Thank you, Leo. I think I’m starting to see a glimmer of hope.”

Leo smiled, knowing that sometimes all it takes is a little light to chase away the darkness. Together, they watched the stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, a reminder that even in the darkest times, there is always a spark of hope waiting to shine.";;;;;;;;;187887;;;;;;;Social Studies;;;;
;;;;;Social Studies;writing;;;What are the best ways for a community (friends, neighbours, local groups) to support someone who is trying to start their life over after a very difficult time (like losing a job or recovering from illness)?;"Starting over after a difficult time can be very challenging. Whether someone has lost a job, gone through a tough illness, or faced any other hardship, support from the community can make a big difference. Friends, neighbors, and local groups can help in many ways to make this transition easier and more hopeful.

First, emotional support is crucial. When someone is trying to start over, they often feel lonely or discouraged. Friends and neighbors can offer a listening ear. Just being there to talk can help a person feel understood and less isolated. Simple gestures, like inviting them for coffee or a walk, can lift their spirits. It shows that they are not alone and that people care about them.

Second, practical help is also important. Sometimes, people need assistance with daily tasks. This could include helping with grocery shopping, cooking meals, or even doing household chores. Local groups can organize community events where people come together to help those in need. For example, a neighborhood potluck can provide meals for someone who is struggling. These acts of kindness can ease the burden and allow the person to focus on rebuilding their life.

Another way to support someone is by providing resources. Friends and local organizations can share information about job openings, training programs, or health services. If someone has lost a job, knowing where to look for new opportunities can be very helpful. Local groups can also offer workshops or classes that help people learn new skills. This not only boosts confidence but also opens doors to new possibilities.

Additionally, creating a sense of belonging is vital. When someone is starting over, they may feel disconnected from their community. Inviting them to join local clubs, sports teams, or volunteer groups can help them meet new people and build relationships. This sense of belonging can provide motivation and encouragement. It reminds them that they are part of a supportive community that wants to see them succeed.

Finally, celebrating small victories is essential. When someone is trying to rebuild their life, every step forward is important. Friends and neighbors can help by acknowledging these achievements, no matter how small. Whether it’s getting a new job, completing a course, or simply feeling better, celebrating these moments can boost a person’s confidence. It shows that their efforts are recognized and valued.

In conclusion, a community plays a vital role in supporting someone who is trying to start over after a difficult time. Emotional support, practical help, access to resources, a sense of belonging, and celebrating achievements are all ways that friends, neighbors, and local groups can make a positive impact. By coming together, we can help those in need find hope and strength as they begin their new journey. A supportive community can truly make a difference in someone’s life, helping them to rise above their challenges and move forward with confidence.";"Once upon a time in a small town called Willow Creek, there lived a woman named Sarah. Sarah had recently faced a tough time; she lost her job at the local bakery and was recovering from a serious illness. Feeling lost and alone, she decided it was time to start her life over, but she didn’t know where to begin.

One sunny afternoon, as Sarah sat on her porch sipping a cup of chamomile tea, she noticed her neighbor, Mr. Thompson, tending to his garden. The vibrant colors of the flowers danced in the gentle breeze, and the sweet scent of blooming roses filled the air. Sarah admired the beauty but felt a pang of sadness. She wished she could find joy in something as simple as gardening.

Mr. Thompson, noticing Sarah’s distant gaze, called out, “Hey, Sarah! Would you like to help me with my garden? It’s a great way to relax and forget your worries.” 

Sarah hesitated but then nodded. The thought of spending time with someone who cared made her heart feel a little lighter. As she joined him, the sound of laughter and the rustling leaves surrounded them. They planted seeds, watered the plants, and shared stories. With each passing day, Sarah found herself smiling more, and the garden began to flourish, just like her spirit.

One evening, Sarah’s friend Lisa organized a small gathering for the neighbors. They all brought dishes to share, filling the air with the delicious aroma of homemade lasagna, fresh bread, and sweet desserts. As they sat around the table, the warmth of friendship enveloped Sarah. She felt the love and support from her community, and it made her realize she wasn’t alone in her journey.

During the gathering, Lisa suggested they start a book club. “Reading can be a wonderful escape,” she said, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “We can meet every week and discuss our favorite stories.” Sarah’s heart raced at the idea. She loved reading but had forgotten how much joy it brought her. 

The book club became a safe haven for Sarah and her neighbors. They shared laughter, tears, and countless cups of coffee. Each meeting was filled with the sound of pages turning and voices animatedly discussing characters and plots. Sarah felt a sense of belonging, and slowly, her confidence began to rebuild.

One day, while walking through the park, Sarah stumbled upon a community art class. The vibrant colors of paint and the sound of brushes on canvas drew her in. She decided to join, and with each stroke, she poured her emotions onto the canvas. The smell of paint mixed with the fresh air invigorated her spirit. 

As weeks turned into months, Sarah transformed her life. With the support of her friends, neighbors, and local groups, she found a new job at a local art studio, where she could share her passion for creativity. The community had rallied around her, offering encouragement, friendship, and opportunities to heal.

In the end, Sarah learned that starting over doesn’t have to be a lonely journey. With the love and support of a caring community, she discovered the strength within herself to rise again. Willow Creek became not just a place to live, but a home filled with hope, laughter, and the promise of new beginnings.";;;;;;;;;166380;;;;;;;Social Studies;;;;
;;;;;Social Studies;writing;;;"Is it better for governments to promise only small, achievable goals (""underpromise, overdeliver"") or to announce big, ambitious plans (""overpromise"") even if they might not fully succeed? Why?";"In today's world, governments often face the challenge of setting goals for their citizens. Some believe that it is better for governments to promise only small, achievable goals, while others argue that announcing big, ambitious plans is the way to go. This essay will explore both sides of the argument and explain why it is better for governments to underpromise and overdeliver.

First, when governments set small, achievable goals, they create a sense of trust with the public. People feel more confident when they see their leaders making promises that can realistically be met. For example, if a government promises to improve public transportation by adding a few new bus routes, citizens can see the progress and feel satisfied. This builds a positive relationship between the government and the people, as citizens appreciate the effort and results.

Moreover, small goals allow governments to focus on specific issues. By tackling one problem at a time, they can allocate resources more effectively. For instance, if a government aims to reduce pollution in a city, it can start by implementing stricter regulations on factories. Once this goal is achieved, they can move on to other environmental issues. This step-by-step approach not only leads to success but also encourages citizens to support future initiatives.

On the other hand, some argue that big, ambitious plans can inspire people and create excitement. When a government announces a grand project, like building a new high-speed train system, it can motivate citizens to dream big and believe in progress. However, the downside is that these ambitious plans often come with high expectations. If the government fails to deliver on these promises, it can lead to disappointment and distrust among the public. People may feel let down and lose faith in their leaders, which can harm the relationship between the government and its citizens.

Additionally, ambitious plans can sometimes lead to wasted resources. When a government invests a lot of money and time into a project that ultimately fails, it can divert attention from smaller, more achievable goals. For example, if a government spends millions on a large infrastructure project that does not succeed, it may neglect other important areas, such as education or healthcare. This can have a negative impact on the overall well-being of the community.

In conclusion, while big, ambitious plans can be exciting, it is better for governments to promise small, achievable goals. By underpromising and overdelivering, governments can build trust with their citizens, focus on specific issues, and avoid the pitfalls of disappointment and wasted resources. Ultimately, a government that sets realistic goals is more likely to create a positive and productive environment for its people.";"Once upon a time in the vibrant town of Dreamsville, there lived a mayor named Clara. Clara was known for her big ideas and even bigger dreams. She believed that if she announced ambitious plans, the townspeople would rally together and achieve greatness. However, her approach often left the citizens feeling disappointed when things didn’t go as planned.

One sunny morning, Clara stood before a crowd in the town square, her voice ringing with excitement. “I promise to build a magnificent park with a lake, a playground, and a community center! It will be the heart of Dreamsville!” The crowd erupted in cheers, their faces glowing with hope and anticipation.

As the months passed, Clara faced numerous challenges. The budget was tighter than expected, and the land for the park was more complicated to acquire. Instead of the grand park, the townspeople received a small playground and a patch of grass. While it was nice, it wasn’t the dream Clara had painted. Disappointment hung in the air like a thick fog.

One day, while walking through the small playground, Clara met an elderly man named Mr. Thompson. He sat on a bench, watching children play. Clara approached him, feeling the weight of her unfulfilled promises.

“Mayor Clara,” he said, his voice gentle yet firm, “I appreciate your dreams for our town, but sometimes, it’s better to promise small things that we can achieve. When we aim too high, we risk losing the trust of the people.”

Clara pondered his words. That evening, she sat in her office, surrounded by papers and plans. She thought about the times she had overpromised and the disappointment that followed. What if she shifted her approach? What if she focused on small, achievable goals instead?

The next day, Clara announced a new plan. “Instead of the grand park, we will start with a community garden! It will be a place for everyone to come together, grow vegetables, and share stories.” The townspeople were surprised but intrigued. They could see the potential in a community garden.

As the weeks went by, the garden blossomed. Families came together to plant seeds, water the plants, and watch them grow. The laughter of children filled the air, and the smell of fresh soil and blooming flowers created a sense of joy. Clara felt a warmth in her heart as she watched the community thrive.

With each small success, Clara gained the trust of her people. They began to believe in her vision again. Soon, they were ready to tackle bigger projects together, but this time, they did it step by step. They built a small library, then a sports field, and eventually, they returned to the idea of a park, but with a realistic plan and a solid foundation.

In the end, Clara learned that while big dreams are important, it’s the small, achievable goals that build trust and create a strong community. Dreamsville flourished, not because of grand promises, but because of the dedication and hard work of its people, united by small victories.

And so, Clara became known not just as a dreamer, but as a doer, proving that sometimes, it’s better to underpromise and overdeliver, creating a path to success that everyone could walk together.";;;;;;;;;489990;;;;;;;Social Studies;;;;
;;;;;Social Studies;writing;;;Do you agree that loneliness is a major global problem today, like a health crisis? Why do you think people might feel lonelier now than in the past?;"Loneliness is a major global problem today, and many people believe it is as serious as a health crisis. In our fast-paced world, more individuals are feeling isolated and disconnected from others. This essay will explore why loneliness is such a big issue today and why people might feel lonelier now than in the past.

First, it is important to understand what loneliness means. Loneliness is the feeling of being alone, even when surrounded by others. It can happen to anyone, regardless of age, gender, or background. Many studies show that loneliness can lead to serious health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and even physical illnesses. Just like we take care of our bodies, we also need to take care of our mental health. When people feel lonely, it can affect their overall well-being.

One reason why loneliness is a major problem today is the rise of technology. While technology has made it easier to connect with others, it has also created a false sense of connection. Many people spend hours on social media, scrolling through posts and pictures, but this does not replace real-life interactions. Instead of talking face-to-face, people often choose to text or message each other. This can lead to feelings of loneliness because online interactions do not provide the same emotional support as in-person conversations.

Another factor contributing to loneliness is the fast pace of modern life. People are busier than ever, juggling work, school, and family responsibilities. This leaves little time for socializing and building relationships. As a result, many individuals find themselves spending more time alone. In the past, communities were often closer-knit, and people would gather for events, celebrations, and even just to chat. Today, with everyone rushing around, it is easy to feel disconnected from those around us.

Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has made loneliness an even bigger issue. During lockdowns and social distancing measures, many people were forced to stay at home and limit their interactions with others. This led to increased feelings of isolation and loneliness. Even as restrictions have eased, some individuals still struggle to reconnect with friends and family. The pandemic has changed the way we interact, and for some, it has made it harder to form new relationships.

In conclusion, loneliness is indeed a major global problem today, similar to a health crisis. The rise of technology, the fast pace of life, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have all contributed to increased feelings of loneliness. It is essential for us to recognize this issue and take steps to address it. By fostering real connections and supporting one another, we can help reduce loneliness and improve our overall well-being. It is important to remember that everyone deserves to feel connected and supported in their lives.";"Once upon a time in a bustling city, there lived a young woman named Mia. She was surrounded by thousands of people every day, yet she felt an emptiness that echoed in her heart. Mia worked in a busy office, where laughter and chatter filled the air, but when she returned home, the silence was deafening. 

Mia often scrolled through her social media feeds, seeing friends posting pictures of gatherings, vacations, and celebrations. Each image seemed to highlight her solitude. She would sit on her couch, the soft fabric hugging her as she wrapped herself in a blanket, feeling the chill of loneliness seep into her bones. The aroma of her favorite takeout lingered in the air, but the taste of the food was bland compared to the warmth of companionship she craved.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Mia decided to take a walk. The streets were alive with the sounds of laughter and music, but she felt like a ghost passing through. She noticed a small park where children played, their giggles ringing like sweet chimes. Couples strolled hand in hand, sharing whispers and smiles. The sight tugged at her heart, reminding her of the connections she longed for.

As she sat on a bench, watching the world go by, Mia thought about why she felt so alone. In a time when technology connected people more than ever, why did she feel like she was drifting further away? She realized that while social media allowed her to see what others were doing, it also created a barrier. The more she scrolled, the more isolated she felt. The digital world, with its curated images and filtered lives, made her believe that everyone else was happy and fulfilled, while she was stuck in her own bubble of loneliness.

Mia remembered her grandmother, who often spoke of the importance of face-to-face connections. In her grandmother's time, people gathered in homes, shared meals, and spent evenings talking. There were no screens to distract them, just the warmth of human interaction. Mia missed that. She missed the sound of laughter echoing in a room, the smell of home-cooked meals, and the touch of a friend’s hand on her shoulder.

Determined to change her situation, Mia decided to take a step. She joined a local book club, where she could meet people who shared her love for stories. The first meeting was nerve-wracking, but as she walked into the cozy café, the smell of freshly brewed coffee filled her senses. The sound of chatter and the sight of smiling faces made her heart race with hope. 

As the weeks passed, Mia found herself laughing, sharing, and connecting with others. The loneliness that once wrapped around her like a heavy blanket began to lift. She realized that while loneliness is indeed a major global problem, it can be tackled one connection at a time. 

In the end, Mia learned that reaching out, even when it feels daunting, can lead to beautiful friendships and a sense of belonging. The world may be filled with people, but it’s the genuine connections that truly make us feel at home.";;;;;;;;;293273;;;;;;;Social Studies;;;;
;;;;;Social Studies;writing;;;In many countries, people are having fewer children than before. Should this be considered a serious problem that society needs to address? Argue for or against taking action.;"In many countries around the world, people are choosing to have fewer children than in the past. This trend raises an important question: should we consider this a serious problem that society needs to address? I believe that it is essential to take action regarding this issue. Fewer children can lead to several challenges for society, including an aging population, economic difficulties, and a decline in cultural traditions.

First, one of the most significant concerns about having fewer children is the aging population. As people live longer and have fewer children, the number of older individuals in society increases. This shift can create a situation where there are not enough young people to support the elderly. For example, in many countries, there are fewer workers to pay taxes that help fund social services for older citizens. If this trend continues, we may face a future where there are not enough young people to care for the aging population, leading to increased pressure on healthcare systems and social services.

Second, having fewer children can also lead to economic challenges. A smaller workforce means fewer people to fill jobs, which can slow down economic growth. When there are not enough workers, businesses may struggle to find employees, leading to lower productivity and reduced innovation. This situation can create a cycle where fewer workers lead to fewer jobs, which can harm the economy. To maintain a strong economy, it is crucial to encourage families to have more children or to find ways to attract workers from other countries.

Moreover, a decline in the birth rate can also affect cultural traditions and community life. Many cultures have rich traditions that are passed down through generations. When families have fewer children, there are fewer opportunities to share these traditions with the next generation. This can lead to a loss of cultural identity and a weakening of community bonds. Encouraging families to have more children can help preserve these important aspects of society.

Some may argue that having fewer children is a personal choice and that people should be free to decide how many children they want to have. While it is true that individual choice is important, we must also consider the long-term effects of these choices on society as a whole. If the trend of having fewer children continues, we may face significant challenges that could impact future generations.

In conclusion, the trend of having fewer children in many countries should be considered a serious problem that society needs to address. The aging population, economic difficulties, and the decline of cultural traditions are all significant issues that can arise from this trend. It is essential for governments and communities to take action to encourage families to have more children or to find solutions to support an aging population. By addressing this issue now, we can help ensure a brighter future for society as a whole.";"Once upon a time in a small town called Willow Creek, there lived a cheerful couple named Mia and Jake. They were in their early thirties, filled with dreams and aspirations. They loved their cozy home, their jobs, and their little garden where they grew vibrant flowers and fresh vegetables. However, there was one thing they often discussed: the idea of having children.

Mia and Jake had always imagined a bustling household filled with laughter and the pitter-patter of tiny feet. But as they sat on their porch one evening, sipping lemonade and watching the sunset, they began to wonder. “What if we don’t have children?” Mia asked, her brow furrowed in thought. Jake took a sip of his drink, contemplating her question. “Well, we could travel more, focus on our careers, and enjoy our freedom,” he replied, trying to sound optimistic.

As the months passed, Mia and Jake noticed that many of their friends were also choosing to have fewer children or none at all. They attended gatherings where conversations shifted from baby names to travel destinations and career advancements. The sound of laughter filled the air, but it was different—less chaotic, more serene. 

One day, while walking through the town square, they stumbled upon a community event. Families were gathered, children were playing, and the air was filled with the sweet smell of cotton candy and popcorn. Mia watched a little girl chase after a butterfly, her giggles ringing like music. “Look at how happy they are,” she said, her heart swelling with warmth. Jake nodded, but a hint of concern crossed his face. “But what happens when these kids grow up? Will there be enough people to take care of them, to support our community?”

That night, they sat in their garden, the stars twinkling above them. “What if we don’t have enough children to keep our society thriving?” Mia pondered aloud. “What if our town becomes quiet and lonely?” Jake sighed, “It’s a valid concern. We need to think about the future.”

As they discussed their worries, they realized that having fewer children could lead to a serious problem. With an aging population and fewer young people to support them, the balance of society could tip. Schools might close, businesses could struggle, and the vibrant community they loved might fade away. 

Mia and Jake decided they needed to take action. They began volunteering at local schools, mentoring young students and encouraging families to embrace parenthood. They shared their own experiences, highlighting the joys of raising children and the importance of community. They organized events that celebrated family life, bringing people together to share stories and laughter.

Slowly, they noticed a change. More couples began to talk about starting families, inspired by the warmth and connection they felt at the gatherings. The sound of children’s laughter echoed through the streets once more, and the town of Willow Creek began to thrive again.

In the end, Mia and Jake learned that while the choice to have children is deeply personal, it also has a ripple effect on society. They realized that nurturing the next generation is essential for a vibrant future. And so, they embraced their role in fostering a community that valued family, connection, and the joy of raising children together.";;;;;;;;;171826;;;;;;;Social Studies;;;;
;;;;;Social Studies;writing;;;What would be the good things and bad things about living in a world where you couldn't instantly look up facts or news on a smartphone? How would life be different?;"Living in a world without smartphones would bring both good and bad changes to our daily lives. Smartphones have made it easy for us to find information quickly, but if we could not look up facts or news instantly, we would experience a different way of living. This essay will explore the positive and negative aspects of such a world.

One of the good things about living without smartphones is that people might spend more time interacting with each other face-to-face. Without the distraction of checking our phones, we could have deeper conversations and build stronger relationships. Families might gather around the dinner table more often, sharing stories and experiences without the interruption of notifications. Friends could enjoy each other’s company without the urge to scroll through social media. This could lead to a more connected and supportive community.

Another positive aspect is that people would likely become better at remembering information. Without the ability to look up facts instantly, we would need to rely on our memory and critical thinking skills. This could encourage us to pay more attention in school and take notes during lectures. We might also develop a greater appreciation for books and other resources, as we would need to seek out information in different ways. This could lead to a more thoughtful and informed society, where people value knowledge and learning.

However, there are also many bad things about living in a world without instant access to information. One major drawback is that it would be harder to stay informed about current events. News travels quickly today, and without smartphones, we might miss important updates about our communities and the world. This could lead to a lack of awareness about issues that affect our lives, such as politics, health, and the environment. People might feel disconnected from the world around them, which could create a sense of isolation.

Additionally, without smartphones, we might struggle to find answers to our questions. In today’s world, if we have a question, we can simply type it into our phones and get an answer in seconds. Without this convenience, we would need to rely on other methods, such as asking friends or searching through books. This could be time-consuming and frustrating, especially when we need information quickly. It might also discourage people from seeking knowledge, as they may feel that finding answers is too difficult.

In conclusion, living in a world without smartphones would have both positive and negative effects. On one hand, we could enjoy more meaningful interactions and develop better memory skills. On the other hand, we might struggle to stay informed and find answers to our questions. Life would be different, as we would need to adapt to a slower pace of information gathering. While there are benefits to this lifestyle, the challenges it presents could make it difficult for us to navigate our modern world. Ultimately, it is important to find a balance between using technology and engaging with the world around us.";"What if the world suddenly lost the ability to look up facts or news on our smartphones? Imagine a day when the screens went dark, and the internet was just a memory. This is the story of a small town called Willow Creek, where life took a turn for the unexpected.

In Willow Creek, people relied heavily on their smartphones for everything. From checking the weather to finding the nearest coffee shop, their lives were intertwined with technology. One sunny morning, the town woke up to a strange silence. The usual buzz of notifications was gone. Confused, the townsfolk gathered in the square, their faces lit by the soft glow of their phones, only to find that nothing worked. Panic spread like wildfire.

At first, the absence of instant information felt like a disaster. Sarah, a high school student, had a big history test that day. She usually spent the night before cramming facts from her favorite educational app. Now, she felt lost. The weight of uncertainty pressed down on her. How would she remember the dates and events without her trusty smartphone?

But as the days passed, something remarkable began to happen. The people of Willow Creek started to talk to each other. They gathered in the park, sharing stories and knowledge. Sarah found herself sitting under a big oak tree with her friends, discussing history. They laughed and debated, recalling what they had learned in class. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the sound of children playing nearby. 

Without smartphones, the townsfolk began to rely on their memories and each other. Mr. Thompson, the local librarian, became a hero. He opened the library every day, inviting everyone to come and share what they knew. The shelves were filled with dusty books, and the smell of old paper filled the air. People would gather around, listening to stories of the past, learning from one another. 

However, not everything was perfect. The lack of instant news meant that misinformation spread quickly. Rumors about a storm brewing in the nearby mountains caused panic. People rushed to prepare, only to find out later that it was just a misunderstanding. The absence of reliable information made it hard to know what was true and what was not.

As weeks turned into months, life in Willow Creek transformed. The townsfolk became closer, forming bonds that technology had once kept at bay. They learned to appreciate the beauty of conversation, the joy of storytelling, and the thrill of discovery. Sarah, who once relied on her smartphone, found herself enjoying the thrill of learning through discussions and books. 

In this new world, people began to notice the little things. The sound of birds chirping in the morning, the taste of fresh bread from the bakery, and the warmth of the sun on their skin became more vivid. They learned to slow down, to savor life without the constant distraction of notifications.

In the end, living without smartphones taught the people of Willow Creek valuable lessons about connection, community, and the importance of knowledge. While they missed the convenience of instant information, they discovered that sometimes, the best way to learn is through each other. And in that small town, life became richer, fuller, and more meaningful than ever before.";;;;;;;;;503144;;;;;;;Social Studies;;;;
;;;;;History;writing;;;Write a diary entry pretending to be a teenager living exactly 100 years ago today. Describe your typical day, your hopes, and things that might seem strange to us now.;"October 24, 1923

Dear Diary,

Today was just like any other day in my life as a teenager in 1923. I woke up early, as the sun peeked through the curtains of my small bedroom. The sound of my mother calling me for breakfast filled the air. We had oatmeal and toast, which is a common meal in our household. After breakfast, I helped my younger siblings get ready for school. It’s my responsibility to make sure they have their books and lunch packed. 

Once everyone was ready, I walked to school with my friends. We usually take the same route, chatting and laughing along the way. The streets are filled with horse-drawn carriages and the occasional automobile. It’s strange to think that in the future, people might not even use horses for transportation. I enjoy the sound of the hooves clopping on the cobblestones. It feels like a part of our daily life.

At school, we learned about many subjects, but my favorite is history. I love hearing stories about the past, especially about the great wars and how our country was formed. Our teacher, Miss Thompson, is very passionate about teaching, and she makes the lessons interesting. We also have to memorize poems, which I find a bit boring, but I understand it helps us appreciate literature.

After school, I usually go home and do my chores. I help my mother with the laundry, which is done by hand. We have a washboard and a big tub where we scrub the clothes. It takes a lot of time, and I sometimes wish we had a machine to do it for us. I’ve heard that some people are starting to use electric washing machines, but they are still rare in our town.

In the evening, my family gathers around the radio to listen to the news and music. It’s amazing how we can hear voices and music from far away! I dream of the day when we might have moving pictures in our homes, like the ones we see in the theater. I hope to see more inventions that make life easier and more exciting.

As I sit here writing, I think about my future. I hope to go to college and study to become a teacher. I want to inspire young minds just like Miss Thompson inspires us. I also dream of traveling to new places, maybe even to Europe. I’ve heard stories about the beautiful cities and cultures there, and I want to experience them for myself.

Sometimes, I wonder what life will be like in 100 years. Will there be flying cars? Will people still write letters, or will everything be done through machines? It’s hard to imagine, but I hope that the world will be a better place, where everyone can live in peace and happiness.

For now, I will focus on my studies and enjoy my time with family and friends. Life in 1923 is simple, but it is filled with dreams and hopes for the future. I will continue to write in this diary, capturing my thoughts and experiences as I grow up.

Goodnight, Diary.

Dear Diary,

Today was just like any other day in my life as a teenager in this bustling little town. The sun peeked through the curtains of my small bedroom, casting a warm glow on the wooden floor. I could hear the distant sound of a train whistle, a reminder of the world beyond our town. The smell of fresh bread wafted in from the kitchen, making my stomach rumble. Mother was already busy preparing breakfast, her apron dusted with flour.

After breakfast, I grabbed my books and headed to school. The streets were alive with the sounds of horse hooves clattering against the cobblestones and the chatter of neighbors greeting one another. I walked with my best friend, Clara, who always had the most exciting stories to share. We talked about the latest gossip from school and our dreams of the future. I hope to become a teacher one day, inspiring young minds just like my favorite teacher, Miss Thompson.

At school, we learned about history and science, but I often found myself daydreaming about the future. I wonder what it would be like to have machines that could do our work for us or cars that could fly. The thought of such things seems impossible, yet I can’t help but imagine it. 

After school, I joined the girls’ club where we practiced our sewing skills. The sound of needles clinking and the soft chatter of my friends filled the room. We were making dresses for the upcoming spring dance, and I could hardly contain my excitement. The thought of dancing under the stars with the boys from the neighboring town made my heart race. 

As the sun began to set, I returned home, the sky painted in shades of orange and pink. The air was cool, and I could smell the sweet scent of blooming flowers from the garden. I sat on the porch, feeling the rough wood beneath my fingers, and watched as the stars began to twinkle in the night sky. 

Sometimes, I think about how strange our lives must seem to those who lived a hundred years ago. We don’t have the luxuries of electricity in every home yet, and the thought of a telephone still feels like a dream. But I find joy in the simple things, like the laughter of my friends and the warmth of my family.

As I write this, I can hear the faint sound of a radio playing in the distance. It’s a new invention that brings music into our homes, and it feels like magic. I can’t wait to see what the future holds, but for now, I’m content with my little world.

Tomorrow will be another day filled with school, friends, and dreams. I’ll keep writing, hoping that one day, I can look back and remember these moments. 

Goodnight, dear diary.

;;;;;History;writing;;;Think about a big, expensive modern project that faced problems (like California's high-speed rail) and a massive project from ancient history (like the Great Wall of China). What kinds of challenges do big projects face, both then and now?;"Big projects, whether in ancient times or today, often face many challenges. These challenges can come from various sources, including money, planning, and the people involved. By looking at a modern project like California's high-speed rail and an ancient project like the Great Wall of China, we can see that while the times have changed, the problems remain similar.

California's high-speed rail is a modern project that aims to connect major cities in California with fast trains. However, this project has faced many difficulties. One of the biggest challenges has been the cost. The original budget for the rail was much lower than what it has turned out to be. As the project has progressed, costs have increased due to land acquisition, environmental studies, and construction delays. This has led to concerns about whether the project will ever be completed and if it will be worth the money spent.

Another challenge for the California high-speed rail is the planning and coordination required. Building a rail system involves many different groups, including government agencies, construction companies, and local communities. Each of these groups has its own interests and concerns, which can lead to disagreements. For example, some communities do not want the rail running through their neighborhoods, while others are excited about the potential benefits. Balancing these different opinions is a difficult task and can slow down progress.

In ancient times, the Great Wall of China faced its own set of challenges. This massive structure was built to protect China from invasions. One of the main problems was the sheer size of the project. The wall stretches over 13,000 miles, and building it required a lot of resources and manpower. Workers had to gather materials, such as stone and wood, and transport them to the construction sites. This was a huge undertaking that took many years to complete.

Another challenge for the Great Wall was the harsh environment. The wall was built across various terrains, including mountains, deserts, and rivers. Workers had to deal with extreme weather conditions, such as heat in the summer and cold in the winter. These conditions made construction difficult and dangerous. Additionally, the wall was often attacked by enemies, which meant that workers had to be on guard while they built.

Both the California high-speed rail and the Great Wall of China show that big projects can face many challenges. Whether it is the cost, planning, or environmental factors, these issues can slow down progress and create uncertainty. However, despite these challenges, both projects also highlight the determination of people to achieve great things. 

In conclusion, big projects, whether modern or ancient, require careful planning and a lot of resources. They face challenges that can come from many different areas, but the desire to create something significant often drives people to overcome these obstacles. By learning from past projects like the Great Wall of China, we can better understand how to tackle the problems that arise in modern projects like California's high-speed rail.";"Once upon a time, in a bustling city filled with dreams and ambitions, there was a young engineer named Mia. She had always been fascinated by the idea of connecting people and places, and when she heard about the California high-speed rail project, she felt a spark of excitement. This was a modern marvel, a train that could whisk passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco in just a few hours. But as Mia dove deeper into the project, she discovered that it was not as simple as it seemed.

Mia was invited to a meeting where the project leaders discussed the challenges they faced. The room was filled with the sound of papers rustling and voices murmuring. The first challenge was funding. The project had a budget that seemed to grow larger every day. Mia could almost feel the weight of the money slipping through their fingers like sand. She imagined the smell of fresh bills, but instead, there was a tension in the air, thick and heavy.

Then there were the environmental concerns. Mia listened as experts spoke about the impact of the rail on wildlife and natural habitats. She could picture the lush green trees and the vibrant flowers that might be lost forever. The thought made her heart ache. The project needed to balance progress with the preservation of nature, a task that felt almost impossible.

As the weeks went by, Mia found herself drawn to another great project from history: the Great Wall of China. She had read about it in books, but now she wanted to understand the challenges it faced. What if she could travel back in time and meet the builders? She imagined herself standing on the ancient stones, feeling their rough texture under her fingertips. The air would be filled with the sounds of chiseling and the shouts of workers, all united in a common goal.

Mia envisioned the builders facing their own set of problems. They had to deal with harsh weather, treacherous terrain, and limited tools. The taste of dust would linger in their mouths as they toiled under the sun, their backs aching from the weight of the stones. Yet, despite these challenges, they persevered, driven by the vision of a wall that would protect their people.

One day, while walking through the city, Mia stumbled upon a group of children playing with toy trains. They laughed and cheered as the trains zoomed around a makeshift track. In that moment, Mia realized that both the high-speed rail and the Great Wall were more than just projects; they were symbols of hope and connection. They represented the dreams of countless individuals who dared to imagine a better future.

Mia returned to her work with renewed determination. She understood that every big project, whether ancient or modern, faced obstacles. But it was the spirit of collaboration, creativity, and resilience that would ultimately lead to success. As she sat down to draft her ideas, she could almost hear the echoes of the past and the whispers of the future, reminding her that every challenge was an opportunity to build something extraordinary.

And so, with a heart full of hope and a mind brimming with ideas, Mia continued her journey, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, knowing that great things often come from overcoming the toughest obstacles.";;;;;;;;;189728;;;;;;;History;;;;
;;;;;History;writing;;;Why were ancient civilizations so focused on predicting the future using methods like reading bird flight patterns or examining animal organs? What purpose did these practices serve?;"Ancient civilizations were deeply interested in predicting the future. They believed that understanding what might happen next could help them make better decisions in their lives. To do this, they used various methods, such as reading bird flight patterns and examining animal organs. These practices served important purposes in their societies, including guiding their actions, ensuring survival, and connecting them to their beliefs and traditions.

One of the main reasons ancient people focused on predicting the future was to make important decisions. For example, farmers needed to know when to plant their crops. If they could predict the weather or understand the signs of nature, they could plant at the right time to ensure a good harvest. Similarly, leaders of tribes or cities wanted to know if they would win battles or if they should prepare for a drought. By interpreting signs from nature, they felt more confident in their choices, which could lead to better outcomes for their communities.

Reading bird flight patterns was one of the methods used to predict the future. Ancient people observed how birds flew and where they went. For instance, if birds flew high and in a certain direction, it might mean that good weather was coming. On the other hand, if birds flew low or in a different direction, it could signal trouble. This practice helped people prepare for changes in the environment, which was crucial for their survival. By paying attention to these signs, they could avoid disasters and take advantage of good conditions.

Another method was examining animal organs, especially the livers of sacrificed animals. This practice, known as haruspicy, was common in many ancient cultures. Priests or diviners would look at the shape, color, and texture of the organs to interpret messages from the gods. They believed that the condition of the organs could reveal the will of the gods and provide guidance for the future. This practice not only helped people make decisions but also reinforced their beliefs in a higher power that influenced their lives.

These methods of predicting the future also served to strengthen community bonds. When people gathered to interpret signs from nature or animal organs, they shared their thoughts and feelings. This created a sense of unity and purpose among them. They relied on each other for support and guidance, which helped build strong relationships within their communities. Additionally, these practices were often tied to religious beliefs, making them even more significant. People felt that they were part of something larger than themselves, which gave them hope and comfort.

In conclusion, ancient civilizations focused on predicting the future through methods like reading bird flight patterns and examining animal organs for several important reasons. These practices helped them make better decisions, ensured their survival, and connected them to their beliefs and communities. By understanding the signs of nature, they felt more in control of their lives and more connected to the world around them. This desire to predict the future reflects a fundamental human need to seek knowledge and understanding in an uncertain world.";"In a small village nestled between towering mountains and lush green valleys, there lived a wise old woman named Elara. The villagers revered her for her ability to predict the weather, the harvest, and even the outcomes of battles. Elara had a special connection with nature, and she often spent her days observing the world around her, seeking signs that would guide her people.

One sunny morning, as the golden rays of the sun filtered through the leaves, Elara set out to the edge of the village. She found a quiet spot where she could watch the sky and the fields. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the gentle rustle of leaves created a soothing melody. Elara closed her eyes, letting the sounds wash over her, and opened her heart to the signs of the universe.

Suddenly, a flock of birds soared overhead, their wings flapping in perfect harmony. Elara watched intently, noting the direction they flew. “If they head south, it means a harsh winter is coming,” she whispered to herself. The villagers depended on her insights, and she felt the weight of their hopes resting on her shoulders.

As the day went on, Elara decided to visit the sacred grove where the village’s animals roamed freely. The air was thick with the earthy smell of damp soil, and the soft bleats of sheep filled her ears. She approached a young goat, its eyes bright and curious. Elara gently touched its warm fur, feeling the pulse of life within it. She examined its organs, a practice passed down through generations, believing that the health of the animal could reveal the future of the village.

“Your heart is strong,” she murmured, “but your stomach is uneasy. Perhaps the crops will struggle this season.” Elara’s heart sank at the thought, but she knew that her role was to prepare the villagers for whatever lay ahead.

That evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Elara gathered the villagers around the fire. The crackling flames danced in the cool night air, and the smell of roasted meat filled their nostrils. With a calm voice, she shared her findings. “The birds have flown south, and the goat’s heart is strong, but its stomach is troubled. We must prepare for a challenging winter.”

The villagers listened intently, their faces illuminated by the flickering firelight. They understood that Elara’s predictions were not just about foreseeing the future; they were about survival. Her insights guided their planting, harvesting, and even their relationships with one another. They learned to respect the signs of nature, knowing that their lives were intertwined with the world around them.

As the seasons changed, the villagers worked together, planting extra crops and storing food for the winter. Elara’s wisdom had prepared them, and when the cold winds blew, they were ready. They huddled together, sharing stories and laughter, grateful for the guidance that had come from the signs of nature.

In the end, Elara’s practices of reading bird flight patterns and examining animal organs served a greater purpose. They fostered a deep connection between the villagers and the world around them, teaching them to listen, observe, and respect the signs of life. Through her wisdom, Elara not only predicted the future but also united her community, ensuring that they faced whatever came their way together.";;;;;;;;;435875;;;;;;;History;;;;
;;;;;History;writing;;;After the Cold War ended around 1990, many people felt very optimistic. Why was there so much hope then? Looking back, was that optimism justified?;"After the Cold War ended around 1990, many people around the world felt a sense of hope and optimism. This period marked the end of a long-standing conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, which had created tension and fear for decades. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many believed that a new era of peace and cooperation was beginning. People were excited about the possibility of a world where countries could work together to solve problems rather than being divided by ideology.

One reason for this optimism was the belief in democracy and freedom. Many Eastern European countries that had been under Soviet control began to embrace democratic values. Citizens took to the streets to demand their rights, and leaders who had once been oppressive were replaced by those who promised to listen to the people. This wave of change inspired hope that democracy could spread to other parts of the world, leading to a more just and fair society.

Another factor contributing to the optimism was the potential for economic growth. With the end of the Cold War, countries that had been isolated from the global economy began to open up. Nations like Russia and those in Eastern Europe started to adopt market-based economies, which many believed would lead to increased prosperity. The idea that trade and cooperation could bring nations closer together was appealing, and many thought that this would reduce the chances of future conflicts.

Additionally, the end of the Cold War allowed for increased international collaboration on global issues. Problems like climate change, poverty, and disease could now be addressed with a united front. Organizations like the United Nations gained renewed importance as countries sought to work together to tackle these challenges. The hope was that by cooperating, nations could create a safer and more stable world.

However, looking back, we can see that this optimism was not entirely justified. While some countries did make progress toward democracy and economic growth, others faced significant challenges. In Russia, for example, the transition to a market economy was difficult and led to widespread corruption and inequality. Instead of becoming a beacon of democracy, Russia has seen a rise in authoritarianism under leaders like Vladimir Putin.

Moreover, conflicts that were thought to be resolved resurfaced in different forms. Ethnic tensions and nationalistic movements emerged in various regions, leading to wars and humanitarian crises. The optimism that came with the end of the Cold War did not account for the complexities of human behavior and the deep-rooted issues that could not be easily solved.

In conclusion, the end of the Cold War brought a wave of hope and optimism for a better future. Many believed that democracy, economic growth, and international cooperation would lead to a more peaceful world. While there were some positive developments, the reality has shown that this optimism was not fully justified. The world continues to face challenges that require ongoing effort and collaboration, reminding us that hope must be accompanied by action and understanding.";"In the small town of Hopeville, nestled between rolling hills and vibrant fields, the year was 1991. The air was filled with a sense of excitement and possibility. I was a young boy, just ten years old, but I could feel the buzz around me. The Cold War had ended, and the world felt like it was opening up, like a flower blooming after a long winter.

Everywhere I looked, people were smiling. The local diner, where the smell of fresh coffee and pancakes wafted through the air, was filled with chatter about peace and unity. My parents often talked about how the world was changing. They spoke of new friendships forming between countries that had once been enemies. I remember my father, with his deep voice, saying, “This is a new beginning for all of us.” 

One sunny afternoon, I rode my bike to the park, the sun warming my skin and the sound of laughter echoing around me. Children played on swings, their joyful shouts mingling with the rustling leaves. I spotted Mr. Thompson, the town’s old history teacher, sitting on a bench. He was reading a newspaper, and I could see the headline: “Peace in Europe!” I approached him, curious about what it meant.

“Mr. Thompson, what does this peace mean for us?” I asked, my heart racing with hope.

He looked at me, his eyes twinkling. “It means we can dream bigger, young man. It means we can travel, learn from each other, and build a better world together.” 

Those words stuck with me. I imagined a world where I could visit far-off places, taste exotic foods, and meet people from different cultures. The thought of it filled me with excitement. 

As the months passed, the optimism in Hopeville grew. The town organized festivals celebrating different cultures, with music, dance, and food from around the world. I remember tasting spicy samosas for the first time, their warm, flaky crust melting in my mouth. The laughter and joy were contagious, and I felt a part of something much bigger than myself.

But as I grew older, I began to see the cracks in that optimism. The world wasn’t as simple as I had imagined. Conflicts still arose, and not every country embraced peace. I watched the news, and the stories of war and strife began to seep into my dreams. The hope I had felt as a child started to fade, replaced by a more complex understanding of the world.

Looking back now, I realize that the optimism after the Cold War was justified in many ways. It sparked a desire for change and connection that led to significant advancements in technology, communication, and global cooperation. However, it also set the stage for new challenges that we continue to face today.

Hopeville taught me that while optimism can inspire us to dream, it’s essential to remain aware of the realities around us. The world is a tapestry of experiences, both bright and dark, and it’s our responsibility to weave them together with understanding and compassion. 

As I sit here, reflecting on those days, I cherish the memories of laughter, peace, and the sweet taste of samosas. They remind me that hope is a powerful force, one that can guide us through even the toughest times.";;;;;;;;;998632;;;;;;;History;;;;
;;;;;History;writing;;;Pick one of the historical empires from the list that tried (and usually failed) to regain its former glory (like the Neo-Assyrian or Carolingian empires). What past greatness were they trying to recapture?;"The Carolingian Empire, which existed in the early Middle Ages, is a fascinating example of a historical empire that tried to regain its former glory. Founded by Charlemagne in the late 8th century, the Carolingian Empire was once a powerful force in Europe. It covered much of modern-day France, Germany, and parts of Italy. Charlemagne's reign marked a time of cultural revival, military expansion, and strong governance. However, after his death in 814, the empire began to decline, and various leaders attempted to restore its past greatness.

One of the main reasons the Carolingian Empire sought to regain its former glory was its cultural achievements. Under Charlemagne, there was a significant revival of learning and the arts, known as the Carolingian Renaissance. This period saw the establishment of schools, the preservation of classical texts, and the promotion of literacy among the clergy and nobility. After Charlemagne's death, many leaders tried to bring back this cultural flourishing. They believed that by reviving education and the arts, they could restore the empire's prestige and influence in Europe.

Another aspect of the Carolingian Empire's past greatness was its military power. Charlemagne was known for his successful military campaigns, which expanded the empire's territory and secured its borders. After his death, various rulers attempted to recreate this military strength. They sought to unite the fragmented territories and defend against external threats, such as Viking invasions. However, these efforts often fell short, as internal conflicts and lack of strong leadership weakened the empire's military capabilities.

The political structure of the Carolingian Empire also played a crucial role in its attempts to regain former glory. Charlemagne established a system of local governance through counts and dukes, which helped maintain order and loyalty within the empire. After his death, many leaders tried to replicate this system, but they faced challenges. The empire was divided among Charlemagne's grandsons, leading to disputes and fragmentation. This division made it difficult for any single ruler to restore the unity and strength that characterized the empire during Charlemagne's reign.

Despite these efforts, the Carolingian Empire ultimately failed to regain its former glory. The lack of strong leadership, internal conflicts, and external threats contributed to its decline. By the 9th century, the empire had splintered into smaller kingdoms, each struggling for power and control. The Treaty of Verdun in 843, which divided the empire among Charlemagne's grandsons, marked a significant turning point. It solidified the fragmentation of the empire and made it nearly impossible for any ruler to restore the unity and greatness that once existed.

In conclusion, the Carolingian Empire's attempts to regain its former glory were driven by a desire to revive its cultural achievements, military power, and political structure. However, internal divisions and external pressures ultimately led to its decline. The legacy of the Carolingian Empire remains significant, as it laid the foundation for the future development of Europe. While it may not have succeeded in recapturing its past greatness, the empire's influence can still be seen in the cultural and political landscape of modern Europe.";"Once upon a time, in a land where the sun kissed the golden sands of the desert, there existed a great empire known as the Neo-Assyrian Empire. This empire was once a powerful force, stretching across vast territories, filled with grand palaces, bustling markets, and the sounds of chariots racing through the streets. The people of Assyria were proud, their hearts swelling with the glory of their past. But as time passed, the empire began to crumble, and the echoes of its former greatness faded into whispers.

I am Ashur, a young scribe in the city of Nineveh, the heart of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. I spent my days recording the deeds of our kings, the triumphs of our armies, and the beauty of our culture. But as I looked around, I saw the shadows of our once-mighty empire. The walls of our grand palaces were crumbling, and the laughter of children playing in the streets was replaced by the silence of despair. The people longed for the days when our empire was feared and respected, when our armies marched with pride and our cities thrived.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, I gathered with my friends in the marketplace. The air was thick with the scent of spices and roasted meats, but the joy of the feast was overshadowed by our worries. “What if we could bring back the glory of our ancestors?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

My friend Naram, a brave warrior, nodded thoughtfully. “We must unite our people, Ashur. We need to remind them of our strength, our history. We can’t let the world forget who we are!”

Inspired by Naram’s words, we decided to embark on a quest to revive the spirit of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. We gathered a group of like-minded individuals, each with a unique talent. There was Zara, a skilled artist who could paint the stories of our past; Malik, a musician whose melodies could stir the hearts of even the most hardened warriors; and Layla, a wise elder who knew the ancient tales of our ancestors.

Together, we traveled from village to village, sharing our stories, songs, and art. We painted murals that depicted the great kings and battles of our past, filling the walls of our cities with vibrant colors and life. The sound of Malik’s lute echoed through the streets, drawing people together, reminding them of the strength we once held.

As we worked, I could see the spark of hope igniting in the eyes of our people. They began to remember the pride of being Assyrian, the taste of victory, and the warmth of community. The scent of fresh bread and roasted lamb filled the air as families gathered to celebrate our heritage, sharing stories of bravery and resilience.

But as we reached the peak of our efforts, we faced challenges. Rival factions emerged, each claiming to be the true heirs of our empire. The sound of clashing swords filled the air, and the taste of fear lingered on our tongues. It seemed that our dream of regaining our former glory was slipping away.

In that moment of despair, Layla reminded us of the true essence of our empire. “It is not just about power or land,” she said, her voice steady. “It is about unity, culture, and the spirit of our people. We must not fight against each other but come together as one.”

With renewed determination, we shifted our focus. Instead of seeking to conquer, we sought to unite. We organized festivals celebrating our shared history, inviting everyone to participate, regardless of their background. Slowly, the divisions began to fade, and the spirit of the Neo-Assyrian Empire was reborn—not through conquest, but through love and understanding.

As I stand in the bustling marketplace today, I see the vibrant colors of our murals, hear the laughter of children, and feel the warmth of community. The glory of the Neo-Assyrian Empire may never return in the same form, but we have created something new and beautiful. We have learned that true greatness lies not in power, but in the bonds we forge and the stories we share.";;;;;;;;;232106;;;;;;;History;;;;
;;;;;History;writing;;;Did early humans discover fire that was already burning (like from lightning), or did they invent the methods to create and control it themselves? Make an argument for one side.;"Early humans and fire have a long and fascinating history. The question of whether early humans discovered fire that was already burning or invented methods to create and control it themselves is an important one. I argue that early humans invented methods to create and control fire themselves. This ability was a significant turning point in human development and played a crucial role in our survival and progress.

First, let’s consider the idea of discovering fire. It is true that natural events, like lightning strikes, can start fires in the wild. Early humans may have come across these fires and learned to use them. However, simply finding a fire does not mean they could control it. Fire from lightning is unpredictable and can be dangerous. Early humans would have had to learn how to manage fire, which is a skill that goes beyond just finding it. 

On the other hand, the ability to create fire shows a deeper understanding of the world around them. Early humans likely experimented with different materials to see what would burn. They may have tried striking stones together to create sparks or using friction from sticks to start a fire. This process of trial and error demonstrates creativity and intelligence. It is not enough to just find fire; they had to learn how to make it happen on their own.

Moreover, controlling fire was essential for survival. Fire provided warmth, which was crucial for early humans living in cold climates. It also offered protection from predators. By learning to create fire, early humans could cook food, making it easier to digest and safer to eat. Cooking food also made it more nutritious, which helped early humans grow stronger and healthier. This ability to create and control fire was a major advantage that helped them thrive.

Additionally, the social aspect of fire cannot be overlooked. Gathering around a fire likely brought early humans together, fostering communication and cooperation. This social bonding may have led to the development of language and culture. The act of creating fire would have required teamwork, as individuals shared knowledge and skills. This collaboration was vital for the growth of early human societies.

In conclusion, while early humans may have discovered fire from natural sources, the true turning point was their ability to invent methods to create and control it themselves. This skill was not just about survival; it was about innovation and social development. The mastery of fire allowed early humans to improve their lives in many ways, from cooking food to building communities. Therefore, it is clear that early humans did not merely stumble upon fire; they actively learned to harness it, marking a significant milestone in human history.";"In a time long before the world was filled with cities and bright lights, there lived a young girl named Lila. She belonged to a tribe of early humans who roamed the vast, wild lands, hunting and gathering for their survival. The sun would rise and set, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, but the nights were dark and cold, filled with the sounds of rustling leaves and distant howls.

One fateful evening, as Lila and her tribe gathered around a small fire, she noticed something strange in the distance. A flash of light split the sky, followed by a loud crack that echoed through the valley. The ground trembled slightly, and Lila's heart raced with both fear and curiosity. She watched as a tree, struck by lightning, burst into flames, its branches crackling and popping like a thousand tiny fireworks.

Lila's tribe had always relied on the warmth of fire, but they had never seen it born from such chaos. The flames danced wildly, illuminating the night and casting flickering shadows on the faces of her tribe members. They were mesmerized, their eyes wide with wonder. But Lila felt something different—a spark of inspiration ignited within her.

“What if we could make fire ourselves?” she thought, her mind racing with possibilities. She remembered the way her father would strike two stones together, creating sparks that flew like tiny stars. What if those sparks could catch on dry leaves or twigs? What if they could create their own fire, not just wait for nature to provide it?

The next day, Lila gathered her courage and approached her father. “Can we make fire?” she asked, her voice trembling with excitement. Her father looked at her, puzzled. “Fire is a gift from the gods,” he replied. “We must respect it and let it come to us.”

But Lila was determined. She spent days experimenting, collecting dry grass, small twigs, and stones. She struck the stones together, watching as tiny sparks flew into the air. At first, nothing happened. The grass lay still, untouched by the magic of fire. But Lila didn’t give up. She tried again and again, her hands sore and her heart heavy with disappointment.

Then, one sunny afternoon, as she struck the stones once more, a small spark landed on the dry grass. To her amazement, it caught fire! The flames flickered to life, crackling and popping, just like the fire from the lightning-struck tree. Lila jumped up, her heart racing with joy. She had done it! She had created fire!

When she returned to her tribe, they were astonished. Lila demonstrated her newfound skill, and soon everyone was gathered around her, eyes wide with awe. They cheered and celebrated, realizing that they could harness the power of fire themselves. No longer would they be mere spectators of nature’s fury; they had become its masters.

From that day on, Lila’s tribe learned to create and control fire. They used it to cook food, keep warm, and ward off predators. The nights became less frightening, filled with the comforting glow of flames. Lila had not only discovered fire; she had ignited a spark of innovation that would change their lives forever.

In the end, it was not just the lightning that brought fire to early humans; it was their own creativity and determination. Lila’s story reminds us that sometimes, we must take the first step and create our own path, even in the face of nature’s wonders.";;;;;;;;;120061;;;;;;;History;;;;
;;;;;Special Area;writing;;;"Do you believe we have complete ""free will"" to choose everything we do, or are our choices mostly determined by factors like our biology, upbringing, or environment? Explore this idea.";"The question of whether we have complete ""free will"" or if our choices are influenced by factors like biology, upbringing, and environment is a complex one. Many people believe that we can make our own choices freely, while others argue that our decisions are shaped by things we cannot control. In this essay, I will explore both sides of this debate and share my thoughts on the matter.

On one hand, the idea of free will suggests that we have the power to make our own choices. This means that when we decide what to eat for breakfast or which friends to hang out with, we are acting on our own desires and preferences. Supporters of free will argue that we are responsible for our actions and that we can change our lives by making different choices. For example, if someone wants to improve their grades in school, they can choose to study harder and seek help from teachers. This belief in free will gives people a sense of control over their lives and encourages them to take action to achieve their goals.

However, many factors can influence our choices, making it difficult to claim that we have complete free will. Our biology plays a significant role in shaping who we are. For instance, some people may have a genetic predisposition to certain behaviors, such as being more prone to anxiety or aggression. These biological factors can affect how we respond to situations and the choices we make. 

Additionally, our upbringing and environment greatly impact our decisions. The way we are raised, the values we are taught, and the experiences we have all shape our beliefs and choices. For example, a child raised in a supportive and loving environment may be more likely to make positive choices, while a child who experiences neglect or abuse may struggle to make healthy decisions. Our friends, culture, and community also influence our choices. We often look to those around us for guidance, and their opinions can sway our decisions.

In conclusion, while the idea of free will is appealing, it is essential to recognize that our choices are often influenced by various factors. Biology, upbringing, and environment all play a significant role in shaping who we are and the decisions we make. I believe that we have some degree of free will, but it is not absolute. Our choices are a mix of our desires and the influences around us. Understanding this can help us be more compassionate towards ourselves and others, as we recognize that not everyone has the same opportunities or experiences that shape their choices.";"Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a young girl named Lila. Lila was known for her bright smile and curious nature. She loved to explore the fields, climb trees, and dream about the world beyond her village. But as she grew older, she began to wonder about the choices she made and whether they were truly her own.

One sunny afternoon, Lila sat under her favorite oak tree, feeling the warm breeze on her face. She watched the clouds drift lazily across the sky, and her mind wandered. “Do I really choose what I want, or is it all decided for me?” she pondered. 

Lila thought about her family. Her parents were hardworking farmers who had always encouraged her to follow her dreams. They often told her stories of their own childhoods, filled with struggles and sacrifices. Lila realized that their experiences shaped her beliefs and aspirations. She wanted to be a painter, but her parents hoped she would take over the family farm. 

As she sat there, she noticed a butterfly fluttering nearby. Its delicate wings sparkled in the sunlight, and Lila felt a sense of freedom as it danced through the air. “What if I could be like that butterfly?” she thought. “What if I could break free from expectations and choose my own path?”

But then, Lila remembered her best friend, Sam. Sam had grown up in a different environment, one filled with chaos and uncertainty. His choices were often influenced by the struggles he faced at home. Lila admired his resilience, but she also saw how his upbringing shaped his decisions. He often felt trapped, unable to pursue his dreams because of the weight of his circumstances.

Lila closed her eyes and took a deep breath, inhaling the sweet scent of wildflowers around her. She could hear the distant sound of laughter from children playing, and it reminded her of the joy that came from simple moments. “Maybe our choices are a mix of both,” she thought. “We have some freedom, but we are also shaped by our biology, upbringing, and environment.”

As the sun began to set, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Lila felt a sense of clarity. She realized that while she could choose to be a painter, her journey would be influenced by her family’s hopes, her friendship with Sam, and the beauty of the world around her. 

With newfound determination, Lila stood up and brushed the grass off her dress. She decided to pursue her passion for painting, but she would do it in a way that honored her family’s legacy. She would paint the fields, the trees, and the laughter of children, capturing the essence of her village while following her dreams.

In that moment, Lila understood that free will was not about making choices in isolation. It was about navigating the complex web of influences that shaped her life. She smiled, feeling grateful for the journey ahead, knowing that her choices were hers to make, even if they were colored by the world around her. 

And so, Lila embraced her path, ready to paint her story, one brushstroke at a time.";;;;;;;;;981776;;;;;;;Special Area;;;;
;;;;;Special Area;writing;;;"Is rebuilding an old historic building, bringing back an old company's name for new products, and an artist re-recording their old songs all the same kind of ""revival""? Discuss the similarities and differences.";"Revival is a term that can mean bringing something back to life or making it popular again. In our world, we see many examples of revival, such as rebuilding old historic buildings, bringing back old company names for new products, and artists re-recording their old songs. While these actions share the idea of reviving something from the past, they also have important differences.

First, let’s look at the revival of historic buildings. When a city decides to rebuild an old building, it often does so to preserve history and culture. For example, an old theater that has been closed for years might be restored to its former glory. This not only helps keep the history alive but also provides a space for community events, performances, and gatherings. The goal here is to honor the past while creating a place for people to enjoy in the present. 

In contrast, reviving an old company name for new products focuses more on business and marketing. When a company brings back a name that people remember, it hopes to attract customers who have fond memories of that brand. For instance, a snack company might reintroduce a popular candy from the past, hoping that nostalgia will encourage people to buy it again. This type of revival is often driven by profit and the desire to tap into the emotions of consumers. While it connects to the past, the main goal is to make money in the present.

Now, let’s consider artists who re-record their old songs. This type of revival can be seen as a way for musicians to reconnect with their fans and share their music in a new way. When an artist re-records a song, they might change the arrangement or add new elements to it. This can breathe new life into a classic tune and introduce it to a younger audience. However, unlike the revival of buildings or company names, this action is often more personal. It reflects the artist’s growth and changes over time, allowing them to express themselves in a different way while still honoring their past work.

Despite these differences, all three types of revival share a common thread: they seek to connect the past with the present. Whether it’s a building, a brand, or a song, each revival aims to bring something valuable from history into today’s world. They remind us of what once was and allow us to appreciate it in a new light. 

In conclusion, while rebuilding historic buildings, reviving old company names, and re-recording songs are all forms of revival, they serve different purposes. Historic buildings focus on preserving culture, company names aim for profit through nostalgia, and artists seek personal expression and connection with their audience. Each type of revival enriches our lives in unique ways, showing us that the past can still have a place in our modern world.";"Once upon a time in a quaint little town named Elderville, there stood an old, crumbling building known as the Grand Oak Theater. It had been a hub of creativity and joy for decades, hosting plays, concerts, and community gatherings. However, as time passed, the theater fell into disrepair, its vibrant colors faded, and its once-lively stage became silent. 

One day, a passionate young architect named Clara visited the town. She had heard stories of the Grand Oak Theater and its glorious past. As she walked through the dusty halls, she could almost hear the echoes of laughter and applause. Clara felt a spark of inspiration. What if she could bring the theater back to life? 

Clara gathered a team of local craftsmen and artists. They worked tirelessly, restoring the building to its former glory. They painted the walls in bright colors, fixed the broken seats, and even installed a new sound system. The smell of fresh paint and wood filled the air, and the sound of hammers and saws became the new music of the theater. 

After months of hard work, the Grand Oak Theater was ready for its grand reopening. The townspeople gathered, their faces filled with excitement. As the curtains opened, Clara stood backstage, her heart racing. The audience erupted in applause, and Clara felt a sense of fulfillment. She had not only rebuilt a building but had revived the spirit of the community.

Meanwhile, in a nearby studio, a famous musician named Leo was facing a different kind of revival. Years ago, he had released a hit album that had touched the hearts of many. However, as new music trends emerged, Leo's old songs faded into the background. One day, while reminiscing, he decided to re-record his classic hits with a fresh twist. 

Leo entered the studio, surrounded by modern instruments and talented young musicians. The sound of guitars, drums, and keyboards filled the air, blending the old with the new. As he sang, he felt the familiar emotions of his past, but this time, they were infused with a contemporary vibe. The smell of coffee and the warmth of the studio made him feel at home. 

When Leo released his re-recorded album, it was met with enthusiasm. Fans old and new celebrated the revival of his music, and Leo felt a connection to his past while embracing the present. 

In another part of town, a local artist named Mia was also experiencing a revival. She had created beautiful paintings years ago, but as life got busy, her art took a backseat. One day, she decided to revisit her old works and reimagine them. 

Mia set up her easel in her sunlit studio, surrounded by the smell of paint and the sound of birds chirping outside. As she painted, she felt the textures of the canvas beneath her fingers, and the colors danced before her eyes. Each brushstroke was a journey back in time, yet it was also a step forward into her new artistic vision. 

When Mia showcased her reimagined art at a local gallery, people were captivated. They could see the evolution of her style, and the revival of her passion resonated with everyone who viewed her work. 

In Elderville, the revival of the Grand Oak Theater, Leo's re-recorded songs, and Mia's reimagined art all shared a common thread. They were about breathing new life into something cherished, whether it was a building, music, or art. Each revival was a bridge connecting the past to the present, allowing people to experience nostalgia while embracing change.

However, the differences lay in their forms. The theater was a physical space, a community gathering point, while Leo's music and Mia's art were expressions of individual creativity. Each revival had its unique flavor, yet they all celebrated the beauty of rediscovery and the joy of sharing it with others.

As the sun set over Elderville, the town buzzed with the energy of revival, reminding everyone that sometimes, looking back can lead to something beautiful in the future.";;;;;;;;;621447;;;;;;;Special Area;;;;
;;;;;Special Area;writing;;;Besides a campfire, what other important things in life or society are much easier to keep going than they are to restart once they've stopped or been broken? (Think about things like trust, a friendship, a local tradition, or even nature).;"In life, there are many things that are easier to maintain than to restart once they have stopped or been broken. One of the most important of these is trust. Trust is the foundation of all relationships, whether they are friendships, family bonds, or professional connections. When trust is strong, relationships can flourish. However, once trust is broken, it can be very difficult to rebuild. 

Trust is built over time through consistent actions and honesty. For example, when a friend keeps a secret or helps you when you are in need, it strengthens the bond between you. However, if that friend betrays your trust by sharing your secret or not being there when you need them, it can create a rift that is hard to mend. People may find it challenging to forgive and forget, and the relationship may never return to its original state. This shows how important it is to nurture trust and keep it alive.

Another important aspect of life that is easier to maintain than to restart is friendship. Friendships require effort and time to grow. When friends spend time together, share experiences, and support each other, their bond becomes stronger. However, if friends drift apart due to lack of communication or misunderstandings, it can be hard to reconnect. Rebuilding a friendship often requires addressing past issues and putting in extra effort to regain the closeness that once existed. 

Local traditions also fall into this category. Traditions are important for bringing communities together and creating a sense of belonging. They can include annual festivals, holiday celebrations, or even simple family rituals. When these traditions are practiced regularly, they become a cherished part of life. However, if a tradition is neglected or forgotten, it can be difficult to revive. People may lose interest, and the younger generation may not feel connected to the tradition. This can lead to a loss of cultural identity and community spirit.

Nature is another example of something that is easier to keep going than to restart. Healthy ecosystems require balance and care. When we take care of our environment, plants and animals thrive, and we enjoy the benefits of clean air and water. However, when we harm nature through pollution or deforestation, it can take years, if not decades, to restore what has been lost. Once a species goes extinct or a habitat is destroyed, it is nearly impossible to bring it back. This highlights the importance of protecting our natural world while we still can.

In conclusion, trust, friendship, local traditions, and nature are all vital parts of our lives that are much easier to maintain than to restart once they have been broken or lost. It is essential to recognize their value and put in the effort to keep them alive. By doing so, we can create stronger relationships, foster a sense of community, and protect the environment for future generations. Taking care of these important aspects of life ensures a happier and more connected society.";"Once upon a time in a small village nestled between rolling hills, there lived a young girl named Lila. Lila was known for her bright smile and her love for the village’s annual harvest festival. Every year, the villagers would come together to celebrate the fruits of their labor, sharing food, laughter, and stories around a great bonfire. The festival was a cherished tradition, but one year, something changed.

As the festival approached, Lila noticed that her best friend, Mia, had become distant. They had spent countless hours together, picking apples and planning their costumes, but now Mia was often absent, lost in her own world. Lila felt a pang of sadness, realizing that their friendship was flickering like a candle in the wind.

The night of the festival arrived, and the village was alive with excitement. The air was filled with the sweet scent of baked pies and roasted corn. Lila could hear the joyful laughter of children and the rhythmic beat of drums echoing through the night. But as she looked around, she felt a void where Mia should have been. The bonfire crackled and popped, casting a warm glow on the faces of the villagers, but Lila’s heart felt cold.

Determined to rekindle their friendship, Lila approached Mia, who stood alone at the edge of the festivities. “Hey, Mia! I’ve missed you. Come join us!” Lila called out, her voice filled with hope.

Mia looked up, her eyes reflecting the flickering flames. “I don’t know, Lila. I just feel different now. It’s hard to be around everyone,” she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.

Lila’s heart sank. She understood that trust, like a campfire, was fragile. Once it dimmed, it was much harder to reignite. “But we’ve always been together. Remember the time we stayed up late, telling ghost stories by the fire?” Lila asked, trying to spark a memory.

Mia’s expression softened for a moment, but the shadows of doubt still lingered. “I remember, but things have changed. I don’t know if we can go back to how it was,” she said, her voice trembling.

Lila took a deep breath, feeling the warmth of the bonfire on her skin. “What if we start small? Let’s just sit together for a while. We can share a slice of pie and talk about anything. We don’t have to rush back to how it was, but we can take a step forward,” she suggested.

Mia hesitated, but the aroma of the freshly baked apple pie wafted through the air, pulling her in. Slowly, she nodded and followed Lila to a cozy spot near the fire. As they sat together, the warmth of the flames surrounded them, and Lila could feel the tension begin to melt away.

They shared stories, laughter, and even a few tears. With each passing moment, the bond that had once felt broken began to mend. Lila realized that while it was easier to keep a friendship alive than to restart it once it had faded, the effort was worth it. Just like a campfire, trust needed tending, and sometimes, all it took was a little spark to reignite the flame.

As the night wore on, the festival continued around them, but Lila and Mia had created their own little world, filled with warmth and understanding. They learned that while some things in life are easier to maintain than to restart, the journey of rekindling a friendship could be just as beautiful as the original flame. And in that moment, under the starlit sky, they knew they had taken the first step toward rebuilding what had once felt lost.";;;;;;;;;671515;;;;;;;Special Area;;;;
;;;;;Special Area;writing;;;Is our brain's tendency to see faces in clouds or patterns in random noise (pareidolia) a silly mistake, or is it actually connected to our ability to be creative and imagine new things?;"Pareidolia is a fascinating phenomenon where our brains see familiar patterns, like faces, in random objects or images. For example, when we look at clouds, we might see a face or an animal. Some people think this is just a silly mistake, but it is actually connected to our creativity and imagination. Understanding pareidolia can help us appreciate how our minds work and how they contribute to our ability to create new ideas.

First, it is important to recognize that pareidolia is a natural part of how our brains function. Our brains are wired to recognize patterns because this ability has helped humans survive throughout history. For instance, being able to quickly identify a face in a crowd can help us find friends or recognize threats. This skill is so important that our brains have developed a tendency to see faces even when they are not really there. This means that when we look at clouds or other random shapes, our brains are simply doing what they are designed to do: look for familiar patterns.

Moreover, this tendency to see faces and patterns is not just a mistake; it is also a sign of creativity. Creativity involves making connections between different ideas and seeing things in new ways. When we see a face in a cloud, we are using our imagination to create a story or a meaning from something that is otherwise random. This ability to find meaning in chaos is a key part of being creative. Artists, writers, and inventors often rely on this skill to come up with new ideas and solutions.

Additionally, pareidolia can inspire creativity in others. When people share their experiences of seeing faces in clouds or other objects, it can spark new ideas and encourage others to look at the world differently. For example, a child who sees a dinosaur in a cloud might be inspired to draw a picture or write a story about it. This shows how pareidolia can lead to creative expression and exploration.

Furthermore, pareidolia can also help us connect with our emotions. When we see a face in a cloud, it can evoke feelings of happiness, nostalgia, or even fear. These emotional responses can fuel our creativity, as they encourage us to express our feelings through art, writing, or other forms of creativity. By recognizing the faces and patterns around us, we can tap into our emotions and use them to inspire our creative work.

In conclusion, pareidolia is not just a silly mistake; it is a reflection of our brain's natural tendency to recognize patterns and a powerful tool for creativity. By understanding this phenomenon, we can appreciate how our minds work and how they help us imagine new things. Whether we see a face in a cloud or a pattern in random noise, we are engaging in a creative process that connects us to our emotions and the world around us. Embracing pareidolia can lead to new ideas, artistic expression, and a deeper understanding of ourselves and our creativity.";"What if our brains were like artists, painting pictures in the sky and creating stories from the simplest things? Imagine a world where every cloud, every shadow, and every rustle of leaves held a secret waiting to be uncovered. This is the world of pareidolia, where our minds see faces in clouds and patterns in random noise. 

One sunny afternoon, I found myself lying on the grass in my backyard, staring up at the sky. The clouds drifted lazily, their fluffy forms shifting and changing. As I squinted, I saw a cloud that looked just like a giant rabbit, its ears flopping in the breeze. Next to it, another cloud resembled a smiling face, its eyes twinkling with mischief. I giggled, feeling a rush of joy as my imagination took flight. 

In that moment, I wasn’t just seeing clouds; I was creating stories. The rabbit cloud was on a quest for the biggest carrot in the world, while the smiling face was cheering it on. I could almost hear the rabbit’s soft thumps on the ground and the gentle rustle of grass as it hopped along. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and I could taste the warmth of the sun on my skin. 

As I lay there, I realized that this wasn’t a silly mistake of my brain. It was a beautiful gift. Our ability to see faces and patterns in random things connects us to our creativity. It allows us to imagine new worlds and tell stories that inspire us. Just like artists who see potential in a blank canvas, we see potential in the ordinary. 

Later that day, I shared my cloud stories with my little sister, Mia. Her eyes sparkled with excitement as I described the rabbit’s adventures. “What if the rabbit met a wise old owl?” she suggested, her imagination igniting. Together, we created a tale of friendship and bravery, where the rabbit learned valuable lessons from the owl. 

This experience made me think about how pareidolia is not just about seeing shapes; it’s about connection. It connects us to each other, as we share our interpretations of the world around us. It connects us to our inner selves, allowing us to explore our thoughts and feelings through creativity. 

In a way, pareidolia is like a bridge between reality and imagination. It encourages us to look beyond the surface and find meaning in the chaos. Just as a painter sees a masterpiece in a splash of paint, we can find stories in the clouds and patterns in the noise of life. 

So, the next time you see a face in the clouds or a shape in the shadows, embrace it. Let your imagination run wild. After all, our brains are not making silly mistakes; they are inviting us to dream, to create, and to connect with the world in ways we never thought possible. In this magical dance of creativity, we discover that every cloud holds a story, and every moment is an opportunity to imagine something new.";;;;;;;;;951196;;;;;;;Special Area;;;;
;;;;;Special Area;writing;;;Do you think the future will mostly be built by using old ideas and materials in new, creative ways, or will it require inventing completely new things we can't even imagine yet? Which path excites you more?;"The future is a topic that sparks a lot of imagination and debate. When we think about how our world will change, we can see two main paths. One path involves using old ideas and materials in new and creative ways. The other path focuses on inventing completely new things that we cannot even imagine yet. Both paths have their own excitement, but I believe that the future will mostly be built by using old ideas and materials in innovative ways.

First, let’s consider the idea of using old materials. Throughout history, people have taken what they already have and improved upon it. For example, many buildings today are made from recycled materials. This not only helps the environment but also gives a new life to things that might have been thrown away. By using old materials, we can create something beautiful and useful while reducing waste. This approach shows that we can be creative with what we already know.

Moreover, old ideas can be reimagined to fit modern needs. Take transportation, for instance. The bicycle has been around for over a century, but today we see electric bikes and scooters that make it easier for people to get around. These new forms of transportation are based on the old idea of the bicycle but have been updated to meet today’s demands for convenience and sustainability. This shows that we can take something familiar and make it better, which is an exciting way to think about the future.

In addition, using old ideas can lead to a sense of connection with our past. When we build on what has come before us, we honor the creativity and hard work of those who lived before us. This connection can inspire us to think more deeply about our own contributions to the world. It reminds us that we are part of a larger story, and that our innovations are just the next chapter in a long history of human creativity.

On the other hand, the idea of inventing completely new things is also thrilling. The thought of creating something that has never existed before can be very appealing. However, this path can be risky. New inventions often require a lot of time, money, and resources. Many new ideas fail before they succeed. While it is important to dream big and think outside the box, relying solely on new inventions can lead to uncertainty.

In conclusion, while both paths have their merits, I believe that the future will mostly be built by using old ideas and materials in new, creative ways. This approach allows us to be innovative while also respecting our past. It encourages sustainability and creativity, making it a practical choice for the future. As we move forward, let us embrace the old while also dreaming of what is possible. By doing so, we can create a future that is both exciting and grounded in the wisdom of those who came before us.";"What if the future was a giant puzzle, where each piece was made from old ideas and materials, but when put together, created something entirely new? 

In a small town called Innovatia, there lived a young inventor named Leo. He was known for his wild imagination and his love for tinkering with old gadgets. One sunny afternoon, while rummaging through his grandfather's dusty attic, Leo stumbled upon a box filled with forgotten treasures: an old radio, a broken bicycle, and a collection of colorful bottle caps. 

As he sat on the wooden floor, the sunlight streaming through the window, he could almost hear the whispers of the past. The radio crackled softly, as if it wanted to share stories of the music it once played. The bicycle, with its rusty frame, seemed to long for the days when it raced down the streets, wind in its tires. The bottle caps, vibrant and shiny, sparkled like tiny jewels, each one holding a memory of a refreshing drink on a hot summer day.

“What if I could bring these old things back to life?” Leo thought, his heart racing with excitement. He imagined a world where the past and the future danced together, creating something magical. 

With determination, Leo set to work. He took apart the radio, carefully removing its components, and used the speakers to create a sound system for his new invention. He transformed the bicycle into a pedal-powered generator, harnessing energy from his own legs. The bottle caps became colorful buttons on a control panel, each one triggering a different sound or light. 

Days turned into weeks, and Leo poured his heart into this project. The attic became a symphony of sounds: the whirring of tools, the clinking of metal, and the soft hum of creativity. He could smell the wood shavings and the faint scent of oil from the bicycle, a reminder of the hard work he was putting in. 

Finally, the day came when Leo unveiled his creation to the town. It was a magnificent contraption that combined music, light, and energy in a way no one had ever seen before. As he pedaled, the bicycle generated electricity, powering the radio and lighting up the bottle caps, which blinked in rhythm with the music. The townspeople gathered, their eyes wide with wonder, as they experienced the magic of old ideas transformed into something new.

Leo’s invention sparked a wave of creativity in Innovatia. People began to look at their old belongings differently, seeing potential where they once saw junk. They started to create art from discarded materials, build homes from recycled wood, and even invent new gadgets using parts from the past. 

In that moment, Leo realized that the future didn’t have to be about inventing completely new things. It could be about reimagining what already existed, breathing new life into forgotten treasures. The excitement of blending the old with the new filled him with joy, and he knew this was just the beginning.

As the sun set over Innovatia, casting a warm glow on the town, Leo smiled. He understood that the future was a beautiful tapestry woven from the threads of history, and he was thrilled to be a part of it. The possibilities were endless, and he couldn’t wait to see what other wonders would emerge from the past.";;;;;;;;;137025;;;;;;;Special Area;;;;
